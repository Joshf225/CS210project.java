<a name="l29"><span class="ln">29   </span></a><span class="s0">“Yeah, a friend.” The short man laughed hoarsely.</span>
<a name="l30"><span class="ln">30   </span></a><span class="s0">“Ah, I see.” Mr.</span>
<a name="l31"><span class="ln">31   </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m in quite a rush,” Mr.</span>
<a name="l32"><span class="ln">32   </span></a><span class="s0">“We want the book,” he said.</span>

<a name="l56"><span class="ln">56   </span></a><span class="s0">“That’s a brand-new book!” he shouted.</span>
<a name="l57"><span class="ln">57   </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s still a book,” Clyde said.</span>
<a name="l58"><span class="ln">58   </span></a><span class="s0">“He’s a publisher!</span>
<a name="l59"><span class="ln">59   </span></a><span class="s0">He’s going to have books on him.</span>

<a name="l70"><span class="ln">70   </span></a><span class="s0">His nearly priceless treasure would never be discovered.</span>
<a name="l71"><span class="ln">71   </span></a><span class="s0">“You ready?” Emily glanced at the clock.</span>
<a name="l72"><span class="ln">72   </span></a><span class="s0">One minute to go until Mr.</span>
<a name="l73"><span class="ln">73   </span></a><span class="s0">“I’ll leave the radio on.</span>
<a name="l74"><span class="ln">74   </span></a><span class="s0">I know you don’t want to miss anything,” he said.</span>
<a name="l75"><span class="ln">75   </span></a><span class="s0">Her brother couldn’t care less that they were moving again.</span>

<a name="l77"><span class="ln">77   </span></a><span class="s0">Matthew attracted friends like a rainbow attracts leprechauns.</span>
<a name="l78"><span class="ln">78   </span></a><span class="s0">And it never bothered him to leave them behind, either.</span>
<a name="l79"><span class="ln">79   </span></a><span class="s0">“You there, caller?” the DJ asked.</span>
<a name="l80"><span class="ln">80   </span></a><span class="s0">But I don’t know.</span>
<a name="l81"><span class="ln">81   </span></a><span class="s0">I’m feeling worried myself.</span>
<a name="l82"><span class="ln">82   </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold hadn’t shown up.</span>
<a name="l83"><span class="ln">83   </span></a><span class="s0">It was part of the new game!</span>
<a name="l84"><span class="ln">84   </span></a><span class="s0">Her mom rapped on the passenger door.</span>
<a name="l85"><span class="ln">85   </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s disappearance could be launched into a game.</span>
<a name="l86"><span class="ln">86   </span></a><span class="s0">A third-floor window slid open with a squawk.</span>
<a name="l87"><span class="ln">87   </span></a><span class="s0">“You’re blocking the driveway,” the woman shouted.</span>
<a name="l88"><span class="ln">88   </span></a><span class="s0">Lee, isn’t it?</span>
<a name="l89"><span class="ln">89   </span></a><span class="s0">We’re the Cranes—your new tenants?</span>
<a name="l90"><span class="ln">90   </span></a><span class="s0">“Mental note: Do not mess with her driveway,” Matthew said.</span>
<a name="l91"><span class="ln">91   </span></a><span class="s0">Matthew sat cross-legged on the ground.</span>
<a name="l92"><span class="ln">92   </span></a><span class="s0">“Sitway might work.” Emily smiled.</span>
<a name="l93"><span class="ln">93   </span></a><span class="s0">He carefully wrote in a Puzzle Power magazine.</span>
<a name="l94"><span class="ln">94   </span></a><span class="s0">He looked at Emily.</span>
<a name="l95"><span class="ln">95   </span></a><span class="s0">“Moving in?” he asked.</span>
<a name="l96"><span class="ln">96   </span></a><span class="s0">Emily startled a little and blushed.</span>
<a name="l97"><span class="ln">97   </span></a><span class="s0">Had she been staring at him long?</span>
<a name="l98"><span class="ln">98   </span></a><span class="s0">She raised the plastic bin filled with clothes.</span>
<a name="l99"><span class="ln">99   </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m delivering a pizza.” The boy blinked at her twice.</span>
<a name="l100"><span class="ln">100  </span></a><span class="s0">He spread his arms wide and rotated in a circle.</span>
<a name="l101"><span class="ln">101  </span></a><span class="s0">“Dibs on this room,” Matthew called from down the hallway.</span>
<a name="l102"><span class="ln">102  </span></a><span class="s0">It was narrow, like their building.</span>
<a name="l103"><span class="ln">103  </span></a><span class="s0">She’d never had a triangular closet before.</span>
<a name="l104"><span class="ln">104  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily slid the window up and reached an arm out.</span>
<a name="l105"><span class="ln">105  </span></a><span class="s0">Her fingertips almost brushed the neighboring house.</span>
<a name="l106"><span class="ln">106  </span></a><span class="s0">The window directly above hers slid open.</span>
<a name="l107"><span class="ln">107  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily snapped back inside, fearing Ms.</span>
<a name="l108"><span class="ln">108  </span></a><span class="s0">Instead, she heard a repetitive squeaking.</span>
<a name="l109"><span class="ln">109  </span></a><span class="s0">Bewildered, Emily tilted the bucket to see what was inside.</span>
<a name="l110"><span class="ln">110  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily reread the message.</span>
<a name="l111"><span class="ln">111  </span></a><span class="s0">It made no sense.</span>
<a name="l112"><span class="ln">112  </span></a><span class="s0">The boy on the stairs must have sent this.</span>
<a name="l113"><span class="ln">113  </span></a><span class="s0">And what about this grid?</span>
<a name="l114"><span class="ln">114  </span></a><span class="s0">Her mom leaned in her doorway.</span>
<a name="l115"><span class="ln">115  </span></a><span class="s0">But what would she say?</span>
<a name="l116"><span class="ln">116  </span></a><span class="s0">Did you send this to me?</span>
<a name="l117"><span class="ln">117  </span></a><span class="s0">Who else would it be from?</span>
<a name="l118"><span class="ln">118  </span></a><span class="s0">What am I supposed to do with it?</span>
<a name="l119"><span class="ln">119  </span></a><span class="s0">“What are you doing?” Matthew said from behind her.</span>
<a name="l120"><span class="ln">120  </span></a><span class="s0">“Can you go any slower?” Matthew asked.</span>
<a name="l121"><span class="ln">121  </span></a><span class="s0">“This is heavy.” Emily grunted.</span>
<a name="l122"><span class="ln">122  </span></a><span class="s0">She peeked in Ms.</span>
<a name="l123"><span class="ln">123  </span></a><span class="s0">The boy now wore swim goggles along with his scarf.</span>
<a name="l124"><span class="ln">124  </span></a><span class="s0">The grid had to be the key.</span>
<a name="l125"><span class="ln">125  </span></a><span class="s0">Why include it?</span>
<a name="l126"><span class="ln">126  </span></a><span class="s0">When she tried reading it backward, it was gibberish.</span>
<a name="l127"><span class="ln">127  </span></a><span class="s0">The first letter of each word spelled out fifteen.</span>
<a name="l128"><span class="ln">128  </span></a><span class="s0">That couldn’t be a coincidence.</span>
<a name="l129"><span class="ln">129  </span></a><span class="s0">But fifteen what?</span>
<a name="l130"><span class="ln">130  </span></a><span class="s0">And that still didn’t explain the grid.</span>
<a name="l131"><span class="ln">131  </span></a><span class="s0">The clue was a partially finished magic square.</span>
<a name="l132"><span class="ln">132  </span></a><span class="s0">Then she ran downstairs and jumped on the landing.</span>
<a name="l133"><span class="ln">133  </span></a><span class="s0">Lee’s voice rang down the stairs.</span>
<a name="l134"><span class="ln">134  </span></a><span class="s0">“James!” she said.</span>
<a name="l135"><span class="ln">135  </span></a><span class="s0">“Check your bucket,” Emily called after him.</span>
<a name="l136"><span class="ln">136  </span></a><span class="s0">Mary’s Hospital after being mugged in a BART station.</span>
<a name="l137"><span class="ln">137  </span></a><span class="s0">Any plans for a new game were postponed indefinitely.</span>
<a name="l138"><span class="ln">138  </span></a><span class="s0">The words critical condition had worried Emily.</span>
<a name="l139"><span class="ln">139  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold, Emily couldn’t help feeling disappointed about his game.</span>
<a name="l140"><span class="ln">140  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold was doing.</span>
<a name="l141"><span class="ln">141  </span></a><span class="s0">By Jack Kerouac, of course.</span>
<a name="l142"><span class="ln">142  </span></a><span class="s0">“Please?” Emily pleaded again.</span>
<a name="l143"><span class="ln">143  </span></a><span class="s0">She was hoping to avoid that alternative.</span>
<a name="l144"><span class="ln">144  </span></a><span class="s0">Treasure hunts were beneath him.</span>
<a name="l145"><span class="ln">145  </span></a><span class="s0">Good-bye, best friend and partner in crime; hello, pain-in-the-butt brother.</span>
<a name="l146"><span class="ln">146  </span></a><span class="s0">She knocked again.</span>
<a name="l147"><span class="ln">147  </span></a><span class="s0">The song abruptly stopped and then restarted from the beginning.</span>
<a name="l148"><span class="ln">148  </span></a><span class="s0">“What?” he shouted over the music.</span>
<a name="l149"><span class="ln">149  </span></a><span class="s0">“Want to go to the Ferry Building?” Emily shouted back.</span>
<a name="l150"><span class="ln">150  </span></a><span class="s0">“What?” he said.</span>
<a name="l151"><span class="ln">151  </span></a><span class="s0">“You asked if I wanted to go and I don’t.</span>
<a name="l152"><span class="ln">152  </span></a><span class="s0">James says we can take cable cars to get there.</span>
<a name="l153"><span class="ln">153  </span></a><span class="s0">“Fine,” he said.</span>
<a name="l154"><span class="ln">154  </span></a><span class="s0">“What is that?” Emily asked.</span>
<a name="l155"><span class="ln">155  </span></a><span class="s0">“This is where we’ll board,” James said.</span>
<a name="l156"><span class="ln">156  </span></a><span class="s0">A cluster of tourists on motorized, standing scooters approached.</span>
<a name="l157"><span class="ln">157  </span></a><span class="s0">“They’re doing a tour of Lombard Street,” James explained.</span>
<a name="l158"><span class="ln">158  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily rolled her eyes.</span>
<a name="l159"><span class="ln">159  </span></a><span class="s0">“He means fan videos.</span>
<a name="l160"><span class="ln">160  </span></a><span class="s0">And then he shared it on his own blog.</span>
<a name="l161"><span class="ln">161  </span></a><span class="s0">“Oh yeah?” He smoothed his lopsided Mohawk with one hand.</span>
<a name="l162"><span class="ln">162  </span></a><span class="s0">Matthew studied the cowlick, then nodded.</span>
<a name="l163"><span class="ln">163  </span></a><span class="s0">“Steve’s got good taste,” he said.</span>
<a name="l164"><span class="ln">164  </span></a><span class="s0">There was no seat belt or anything.</span>
<a name="l165"><span class="ln">165  </span></a><span class="s0">Everything James pointed out had a story attached to it.</span>
<a name="l166"><span class="ln">166  </span></a><span class="s0">“How long have you lived here?” Emily asked James.</span>
<a name="l167"><span class="ln">167  </span></a><span class="s0">My family has lived in our building forever.</span>
<a name="l168"><span class="ln">168  </span></a><span class="s0">I think my grandfather bought it in the sixties.</span>
<a name="l169"><span class="ln">169  </span></a><span class="s0">My bedroom was my mom’s when she was a kid.</span>
<a name="l170"><span class="ln">170  </span></a><span class="s0">She couldn’t wrap her head around that.</span>
<a name="l171"><span class="ln">171  </span></a><span class="s0">“And I don’t even remember that.</span>
<a name="l172"><span class="ln">172  </span></a><span class="s0">“I was born in Arizona, Phlegmily was born in Washington.</span>
<a name="l173"><span class="ln">173  </span></a><span class="s0">So they thought, Why not live once in every state?</span>
<a name="l174"><span class="ln">174  </span></a><span class="s0">“A couple of times a month, maybe.</span>
<a name="l175"><span class="ln">175  </span></a><span class="s0">It was a simple but stately building.</span>
<a name="l176"><span class="ln">176  </span></a><span class="s0">“Matthew, come on,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l177"><span class="ln">177  </span></a><span class="s0">This was her favorite part of book hunting.</span>
<a name="l178"><span class="ln">178  </span></a><span class="s0">“We look for the book.</span>
<a name="l179"><span class="ln">179  </span></a><span class="s0">It should be hidden somewhere around here.</span>
<a name="l180"><span class="ln">180  </span></a><span class="s0">“No!” She slapped the ground in frustration.</span>
<a name="l181"><span class="ln">181  </span></a><span class="s0">“What’s wrong?” James asked.</span>
<a name="l182"><span class="ln">182  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily pulled the calling card loose and stood up.</span>
<a name="l183"><span class="ln">183  </span></a><span class="s0">“Who’s Babbage?” “I don’t actually know him.</span>
<a name="l184"><span class="ln">184  </span></a><span class="s0">It’s a username for another Book Scavenger player.</span>
<a name="l185"><span class="ln">185  </span></a><span class="s0">He could be anyone.</span>
<a name="l186"><span class="ln">186  </span></a><span class="s0">This is my card.</span>
<a name="l187"><span class="ln">187  </span></a><span class="s0">My first username was something generic, like booknut123.</span>
<a name="l188"><span class="ln">188  </span></a><span class="s0">I never changed it back.” “Surly Wombat.</span>
<a name="l189"><span class="ln">189  </span></a><span class="s0">There was another one just ahead, and then another.</span>

<a name="l204"><span class="ln">204  </span></a><span class="s0">“Matthew, get back here!” Emily yelled after him.</span>
<a name="l205"><span class="ln">205  </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s not closed or anything,” Matthew shouted from below.</span>
<a name="l206"><span class="ln">206  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold had been when he was mugged.</span>

<a name="l210"><span class="ln">210  </span></a><span class="s0">“The Gold-Bug,” Emily read the title.</span>
<a name="l211"><span class="ln">211  </span></a><span class="s0">She flipped the cover open.</span>

<a name="l227"><span class="ln">227  </span></a><span class="s0">James pushed past Matthew when they hit the sidewalk.</span>

<a name="l229"><span class="ln">229  </span></a><span class="s0">His spiky tuft bobbed wildly as they ran.</span>
<a name="l230"><span class="ln">230  </span></a><span class="s0">James headed back in the direction of the Ferry Building.</span>
<a name="l231"><span class="ln">231  </span></a><span class="s0">“Excuse us!” James shouted as they dove through the line.</span>
<a name="l232"><span class="ln">232  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily looked over her shoulder.</span>

<a name="l236"><span class="ln">236  </span></a><span class="s0">“Quiet!” James held a finger to his lips.</span>
<a name="l237"><span class="ln">237  </span></a><span class="s0">A man swore, which echoed in the empty shopping center.</span>
<a name="l238"><span class="ln">238  </span></a><span class="s0">“My great-grandmother,” he explained to Emily.</span>

<a name="l258"><span class="ln">258  </span></a><span class="s0">Nobody would dump a book like this.</span>
<a name="l259"><span class="ln">259  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily flipped to the copyright page.</span>
<a name="l260"><span class="ln">260  </span></a><span class="s0">She clicked on the forum and posted a message.</span>

<a name="l270"><span class="ln">270  </span></a><span class="s0">She scanned Babbage’s book listings.</span>
<a name="l271"><span class="ln">271  </span></a><span class="s0">The computer dinged, and an instant-message box popped up.</span>

<a name="l382"><span class="ln">382  </span></a><span class="s0">He rapped loudly on Matthew’s door before entering the kitchen.</span>
<a name="l383"><span class="ln">383  </span></a><span class="s0">“I propose a treat!” he said.</span>
<a name="l384"><span class="ln">384  </span></a><span class="s0">“A treat?” Emily’s mom asked.</span>
<a name="l385"><span class="ln">385  </span></a><span class="s0">“Does it involve leaving the house?</span>
<a name="l386"><span class="ln">386  </span></a><span class="s0">“Let’s venture down to North Beach,” Emily’s dad said.</span>
<a name="l387"><span class="ln">387  </span></a><span class="s0">“I’ve been dying to see City Lights.” Emily perked up.</span>
<a name="l388"><span class="ln">388  </span></a><span class="s0">“The bookstore?” She remembered reading the name in Mr.</span>
<a name="l389"><span class="ln">389  </span></a><span class="s0">“The one and only,” her dad replied.</span>
<a name="l390"><span class="ln">390  </span></a><span class="s0">“Or I should say, the one and only City Lights.</span>
<a name="l391"><span class="ln">391  </span></a><span class="s0">I imagine there are many bookstores in San Francisco.</span>
<a name="l392"><span class="ln">392  </span></a><span class="s0">“Me too!” her mom said.</span>
<a name="l393"><span class="ln">393  </span></a><span class="s0">“Can we get lunch?” Matthew asked.</span>
<a name="l394"><span class="ln">394  </span></a><span class="s0">“Only in San Francisco!” he shouted.</span>
<a name="l395"><span class="ln">395  </span></a><span class="s0">He was so excited you’d think he was visiting Disneyland.</span>
<a name="l396"><span class="ln">396  </span></a><span class="s0">“Flush at the Fillmore, Dad.</span>
<a name="l397"><span class="ln">397  </span></a><span class="s0">That’s, like, my Jack Kerouac and my City Lights.</span>
<a name="l398"><span class="ln">398  </span></a><span class="s0">I have to go to that concert.</span>
<a name="l399"><span class="ln">399  </span></a><span class="s0">“Your dad didn’t say no.</span>
<a name="l400"><span class="ln">400  </span></a><span class="s0">We just need more information.</span>
<a name="l401"><span class="ln">401  </span></a><span class="s0">Her mom smiled at a book of poetry.</span>
<a name="l402"><span class="ln">402  </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER 11 THUD.</span>
<a name="l403"><span class="ln">403  </span></a><span class="s0">It was Monday morning, Emily’s third day in San Francisco.</span>
<a name="l404"><span class="ln">404  </span></a><span class="s0">Encrypted conversations only.</span>
<a name="l405"><span class="ln">405  </span></a><span class="s0">B OFXZ T CXXQ KBQBFC SJXV.</span>
<a name="l406"><span class="ln">406  </span></a><span class="s0">I know a good hiding spot.</span>
<a name="l407"><span class="ln">407  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily had lucked out moving into James’s building.</span>
<a name="l408"><span class="ln">408  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily stood still.</span>
<a name="l409"><span class="ln">409  </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s like out of a movie,” she said.</span>
<a name="l410"><span class="ln">410  </span></a><span class="s0">“The view.” Emily pointed.</span>
<a name="l411"><span class="ln">411  </span></a><span class="s0">“Yeah, I guess so.</span>
<a name="l412"><span class="ln">412  </span></a><span class="s0">“Like hiding a leaf in a tree,” he said.</span>
<a name="l413"><span class="ln">413  </span></a><span class="s0">“That was Hollister.</span>
<a name="l414"><span class="ln">414  </span></a><span class="s0">He owns the store,” James said.</span>
<a name="l415"><span class="ln">415  </span></a><span class="s0">James whistled long and low.</span>
<a name="l416"><span class="ln">416  </span></a><span class="s0">“How did he do this?” Emily asked.</span>
<a name="l417"><span class="ln">417  </span></a><span class="s0">“This must have taken him forever,” James said.</span>
<a name="l418"><span class="ln">418  </span></a><span class="s0">They pushed open the door.</span>
<a name="l419"><span class="ln">419  </span></a><span class="s0">“Hollister, your window looks amazing!” James said.</span>
<a name="l420"><span class="ln">420  </span></a><span class="s0">You finish the latest Puzzle Power?</span>
<a name="l421"><span class="ln">421  </span></a><span class="s0">“This is Emily.</span>
<a name="l422"><span class="ln">422  </span></a><span class="s0">“Small token of respect for a good man.</span>
<a name="l423"><span class="ln">423  </span></a><span class="s0">She looked to James questioningly.</span>
<a name="l424"><span class="ln">424  </span></a><span class="s0">“You’re friends with Mr.</span>
<a name="l425"><span class="ln">425  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold?” “I said old friend.</span>
<a name="l426"><span class="ln">426  </span></a><span class="s0">A rarebook collector who manages his library.</span>
<a name="l427"><span class="ln">427  </span></a><span class="s0">But the way he acted, talking about Mr.</span>
<a name="l428"><span class="ln">428  </span></a><span class="s0">And if she was honest, part of her felt protective.</span>
<a name="l429"><span class="ln">429  </span></a><span class="s0">Sharing that might ruin the fun somehow.</span>
<a name="l430"><span class="ln">430  </span></a><span class="s0">She cleared her throat.</span>
<a name="l431"><span class="ln">431  </span></a><span class="s0">“Could we hide a book in your store?” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l432"><span class="ln">432  </span></a><span class="s0">“For Book Scavenger?</span>
<a name="l433"><span class="ln">433  </span></a><span class="s0">“It can’t be too difficult,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l434"><span class="ln">434  </span></a><span class="s0">“Can I see your notebook and a pen?” he asked.</span>
<a name="l435"><span class="ln">435  </span></a><span class="s0">“Wrong side out under crafts.</span>
<a name="l436"><span class="ln">436  </span></a><span class="s0">She looked to the front where Hollister was.</span>
<a name="l437"><span class="ln">437  </span></a><span class="s0">“Most of my Poe is out here now.</span>
<a name="l438"><span class="ln">438  </span></a><span class="s0">He’s popular this time of year,” Hollister said.</span>
<a name="l439"><span class="ln">439  </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe that was all Mr.</span>
<a name="l440"><span class="ln">440  </span></a><span class="s0">They weren’t the same.</span>
<a name="l441"><span class="ln">441  </span></a><span class="s0">She exhaled a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding.</span>
<a name="l442"><span class="ln">442  </span></a><span class="s0">She opened Hollister’s and flipped through it.</span>
<a name="l443"><span class="ln">443  </span></a><span class="s0">“That one of your schoolbooks, Emily-Who-Just-Moved-Here?</span>
<a name="l444"><span class="ln">444  </span></a><span class="s0">Looks fancy.” Hollister’s voice made her jump.</span>
<a name="l445"><span class="ln">445  </span></a><span class="s0">She’d gotten lost in thought comparing the two books.</span>
<a name="l446"><span class="ln">446  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s game, James wasn’t showing it.</span>
<a name="l447"><span class="ln">447  </span></a><span class="s0">“So old they’re written on stone tablets?</span>
<a name="l448"><span class="ln">448  </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m reading it for fun.</span>
<a name="l449"><span class="ln">449  </span></a><span class="s0">You say it’s just that one story?</span>
<a name="l450"><span class="ln">450  </span></a><span class="s0">Haven’t come across one like that before.</span>
<a name="l451"><span class="ln">451  </span></a><span class="s0">“You reading this?</span>
<a name="l452"><span class="ln">452  </span></a><span class="s0">“On the house.</span>
<a name="l453"><span class="ln">453  </span></a><span class="s0">Hollister pressed the book on top of The Gold-Bug.</span>
<a name="l454"><span class="ln">454  </span></a><span class="s0">She hadn’t stopped to consider why Mr.</span>
<a name="l455"><span class="ln">455  </span></a><span class="s0">“Raven?” James lowered his voice to Emily.</span>
<a name="l456"><span class="ln">456  </span></a><span class="s0">James raised his eyebrows.</span>
<a name="l457"><span class="ln">457  </span></a><span class="s0">She’s online,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l458"><span class="ln">458  </span></a><span class="s0">SURLY WOMBAT: Can I ask you about THE GOLD-BUG?</span>
<a name="l459"><span class="ln">459  </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe then she won’t be so weird.” James shrugged.</span>
<a name="l460"><span class="ln">460  </span></a><span class="s0">RAVEN: I can’t help you with that.</span>
<a name="l461"><span class="ln">461  </span></a><span class="s0">SURLY WOMBAT: What do you mean?</span>
<a name="l462"><span class="ln">462  </span></a><span class="s0">RAVEN: I do not have the information you seek.</span>
<a name="l463"><span class="ln">463  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily slapped a hand on James’s desktop.</span>
<a name="l464"><span class="ln">464  </span></a><span class="s0">“I don’t understand this!</span>
<a name="l465"><span class="ln">465  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily groaned, but James straightened in his seat.</span>
<a name="l466"><span class="ln">466  </span></a><span class="s0">“She’s playing a game with us,” he said.</span>
<a name="l467"><span class="ln">467  </span></a><span class="s0">“No kidding.” “No, seriously.</span>
<a name="l468"><span class="ln">468  </span></a><span class="s0">There’s a pattern to how she replies.</span>
<a name="l469"><span class="ln">469  </span></a><span class="s0">SURLY WOMBAT: Do you like soda?</span>
<a name="l470"><span class="ln">470  </span></a><span class="s0">RAVEN: I do not have the information you seek.</span>
<a name="l471"><span class="ln">471  </span></a><span class="s0">SURLY WOMBAT: Plaid pants look nice on you.</span>
<a name="l472"><span class="ln">472  </span></a><span class="s0">RAVEN: I can’t help you with that.</span>
<a name="l473"><span class="ln">473  </span></a><span class="s0">SURLY WOMBAT: Who hid THE GOLD-BUG?</span>
<a name="l474"><span class="ln">474  </span></a><span class="s0">“You’re right!” James scrolled back through the conversation.</span>
<a name="l475"><span class="ln">475  </span></a><span class="s0">RAVEN: Your query is incomplete.</span>
<a name="l476"><span class="ln">476  </span></a><span class="s0">RAVEN: That is all the assistance I can offer today.</span>
<a name="l477"><span class="ln">477  </span></a><span class="s0">“That’s it?” James and Emily cried in unison.</span>
<a name="l478"><span class="ln">478  </span></a><span class="s0">“Well, she did tell us something at least.</span>
<a name="l479"><span class="ln">479  </span></a><span class="s0">“They’re not coming back,” Clyde said.</span>
<a name="l480"><span class="ln">480  </span></a><span class="s0">“This card is our lead,” Clyde said.</span>
<a name="l481"><span class="ln">481  </span></a><span class="s0">“Fat lot of good that card does us.</span>
<a name="l482"><span class="ln">482  </span></a><span class="s0">It’s got nothing on it—no address, no name, no number.</span>
<a name="l483"><span class="ln">483  </span></a><span class="s0">Just that picture of Earth and Too Slow!</span>
<a name="l484"><span class="ln">484  </span></a><span class="s0">This book has been found by: Surly Wombat.</span>
<a name="l485"><span class="ln">485  </span></a><span class="s0">After she took our book,” Clyde said.</span>
<a name="l486"><span class="ln">486  </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s not our book,” Barry muttered.</span>
<a name="l487"><span class="ln">487  </span></a><span class="s0">Didn’t talk about it, didn’t seem worried about it.</span>
<a name="l488"><span class="ln">488  </span></a><span class="s0">Almost like he didn’t even remember.</span>
<a name="l489"><span class="ln">489  </span></a><span class="s0">“I said: That’s.</span>
<a name="l490"><span class="ln">490  </span></a><span class="s0">That fugly fountain is cement tactics.</span>
<a name="l491"><span class="ln">491  </span></a><span class="s0">Bad cement tactics.</span>
<a name="l492"><span class="ln">492  </span></a><span class="s0">“What are you talking about?</span>
<a name="l493"><span class="ln">493  </span></a><span class="s0">You lost me with cement tactics,” Barry said.</span>
<a name="l494"><span class="ln">494  </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s our book, it’s their book.</span>
<a name="l495"><span class="ln">495  </span></a><span class="s0">It’s just words, you know?” “Oh,” Barry said.</span>
<a name="l496"><span class="ln">496  </span></a><span class="s0">“You mean semantics, numbnut.</span>
<a name="l497"><span class="ln">497  </span></a><span class="s0">Try reading more books instead of stealing them.” Clyde shrugged.</span>
<a name="l498"><span class="ln">498  </span></a><span class="s0">“I prefer cement tactics.</span>
<a name="l499"><span class="ln">499  </span></a><span class="s0">It’s poetic.” Barry sighed and held out his palm.</span>
<a name="l500"><span class="ln">500  </span></a><span class="s0">There’s nothing useful here.</span>
<a name="l501"><span class="ln">501  </span></a><span class="s0">You want to look up Surly Wombat?</span>
<a name="l502"><span class="ln">502  </span></a><span class="s0">“Maybe.” “Fine, better than the nothing we’ve been doing.</span>
<a name="l503"><span class="ln">503  </span></a><span class="s0">Barry flicked the logo.</span>
<a name="l504"><span class="ln">504  </span></a><span class="s0">“That must be for a business or something.</span>
<a name="l505"><span class="ln">505  </span></a><span class="s0">“These dotted lines outline letters!</span>
<a name="l506"><span class="ln">506  </span></a><span class="s0">It was like a hide-and-seek game with letters.</span>
<a name="l507"><span class="ln">507  </span></a><span class="s0">He was proud of himself for spotting them.</span>
<a name="l508"><span class="ln">508  </span></a><span class="s0">Clyde tapped the screen.</span>
<a name="l509"><span class="ln">509  </span></a><span class="s0">“Make that hidden book.” “We didn’t hide it.</span>
<a name="l510"><span class="ln">510  </span></a><span class="s0">She thought it was hidden there on purpose.</span>
<a name="l511"><span class="ln">511  </span></a><span class="s0">That’s why she left that card.</span>
<a name="l512"><span class="ln">512  </span></a><span class="s0">It was hard breaking into a new school.</span>
<a name="l513"><span class="ln">513  </span></a><span class="s0">“Hold on,” he said, and ran back upstairs.</span>
<a name="l514"><span class="ln">514  </span></a><span class="s0">“Take them,” he insisted.</span>
<a name="l515"><span class="ln">515  </span></a><span class="s0">How many first-day-ofseventh-grade pictures did a person need?</span>
<a name="l516"><span class="ln">516  </span></a><span class="s0">“Cheese!” he said.</span>
<a name="l517"><span class="ln">517  </span></a><span class="s0">“Or what do reindeer say?</span>
<a name="l518"><span class="ln">518  </span></a><span class="s0">Moo!” “What?” Emily laughed.</span>
<a name="l519"><span class="ln">519  </span></a><span class="s0">Students’ spiderweb art clung to a concrete brick wall.</span>
<a name="l520"><span class="ln">520  </span></a><span class="s0">Her attention bounced all over the place.</span>
<a name="l521"><span class="ln">521  </span></a><span class="s0">But it was easy to miss a detail that small.</span>
<a name="l522"><span class="ln">522  </span></a><span class="s0">So far that tactic hadn’t worked.</span>
<a name="l523"><span class="ln">523  </span></a><span class="s0">She thought it was more mean-spirited than competitive.</span>
<a name="l524"><span class="ln">524  </span></a><span class="s0">Fort, wild, rat, home.</span>
<a name="l525"><span class="ln">525  </span></a><span class="s0">The bell rang, and the two fell in step.</span>
<a name="l526"><span class="ln">526  </span></a><span class="s0">“Any breakthroughs yet?” James asked.</span>
<a name="l527"><span class="ln">527  </span></a><span class="s0">They had talked about Mr.</span>
<a name="l528"><span class="ln">528  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily shook her head in response to James’s question.</span>
<a name="l529"><span class="ln">529  </span></a><span class="s0">“Me neither,” he said.</span>
<a name="l530"><span class="ln">530  </span></a><span class="s0">“Can I see The Gold-Bug again?” James asked.</span>
<a name="l531"><span class="ln">531  </span></a><span class="s0">Fort, wild, rat, home.</span>
<a name="l532"><span class="ln">532  </span></a><span class="s0">I make a point of knowing everyone in our class.</span>
<a name="l533"><span class="ln">533  </span></a><span class="s0">Welcome to Booker Middle School.</span>
<a name="l534"><span class="ln">534  </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe she hadn’t been intensely focused on Emily after all.</span>
<a name="l535"><span class="ln">535  </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe that was just her normal expression.</span>
<a name="l536"><span class="ln">536  </span></a><span class="s0">The crowd parted as he boomed, “Let’s go, people.</span>
<a name="l537"><span class="ln">537  </span></a><span class="s0">We’ve got dead men to discuss.” Their teacher, Mr.</span>
<a name="l538"><span class="ln">538  </span></a><span class="s0">“New face,” he barked.</span>
<a name="l539"><span class="ln">539  </span></a><span class="s0">“Emily Crane?” “Yes,” she mumbled.</span>
<a name="l540"><span class="ln">540  </span></a><span class="s0">“Grab a textbook from the bookshelf.</span>
<a name="l541"><span class="ln">541  </span></a><span class="s0">“So, Emily Crane,” Mr.</span>
<a name="l542"><span class="ln">542  </span></a><span class="s0">She wasn’t from anywhere.</span>
<a name="l543"><span class="ln">543  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling might interpret that as attitude.</span>
<a name="l544"><span class="ln">544  </span></a><span class="s0">“Um…” There were snickers behind her.</span>
<a name="l545"><span class="ln">545  </span></a><span class="s0">So much for thinking she’d imagined her negative attention earlier.</span>
<a name="l546"><span class="ln">546  </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m not grading you on your response, Ms.</span>
<a name="l547"><span class="ln">547  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling clapped his hands twice to get everyone’s attention.</span>
<a name="l548"><span class="ln">548  </span></a><span class="s0">A-plus for that.</span>
<a name="l549"><span class="ln">549  </span></a><span class="s0">Just kidding, no grade.” Mr.</span>
<a name="l550"><span class="ln">550  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling rubbed his hands together.</span>
<a name="l551"><span class="ln">551  </span></a><span class="s0">“Let’s get to work.</span>
<a name="l552"><span class="ln">552  </span></a><span class="s0">She copied the words Mr.</span>
<a name="l553"><span class="ln">553  </span></a><span class="s0">Making sure Mr.</span>
<a name="l554"><span class="ln">554  </span></a><span class="s0">She grabbed it and slid out the frog-shaped note.</span>
<a name="l555"><span class="ln">555  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling spoke so he wouldn’t hear the rustling.</span>
<a name="l556"><span class="ln">556  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling’s head snapped up.</span>
<a name="l557"><span class="ln">557  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily tucked the note inside The Gold-Bug.</span>
<a name="l558"><span class="ln">558  </span></a><span class="s0">“Is there a problem?” Mr.</span>
<a name="l559"><span class="ln">559  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling said sharply.</span>
<a name="l560"><span class="ln">560  </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m sorry, Mr.</span>
<a name="l561"><span class="ln">561  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling,” Maddie said.</span>
<a name="l562"><span class="ln">562  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling walked down her aisle.</span>
<a name="l563"><span class="ln">563  </span></a><span class="s0">He picked up Maddie’s textbook and handed it back.</span>
<a name="l564"><span class="ln">564  </span></a><span class="s0">Instead of returning to the front of the room, Mr.</span>
<a name="l565"><span class="ln">565  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling hovered over Emily’s desk.</span>
<a name="l566"><span class="ln">566  </span></a><span class="s0">“I don’t recognize this,” Mr.</span>
<a name="l567"><span class="ln">567  </span></a><span class="s0">She couldn’t bring herself to peek at James.</span>
<a name="l568"><span class="ln">568  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling asked the class.</span>
<a name="l569"><span class="ln">569  </span></a><span class="s0">“Who knows what a cipher is?” Mr.</span>

<a name="l581"><span class="ln">581  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling tapped the whiteboard.</span>

<a name="l583"><span class="ln">583  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling wrote out the standard alphabet.</span>

<a name="l603"><span class="ln">603  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling bellowed over the din.</span>
<a name="l604"><span class="ln">604  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling tapped papers into an even pile on his desk.</span>
<a name="l605"><span class="ln">605  </span></a><span class="s0">Do better tomorrow.” Emily nodded obediently, even though Mr.</span>
<a name="l606"><span class="ln">606  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling wasn’t looking at her.</span>
<a name="l607"><span class="ln">607  </span></a><span class="s0">“Mad at you?” James said.</span>
<a name="l608"><span class="ln">608  </span></a><span class="s0">“You should be mad at me.</span>
<a name="l609"><span class="ln">609  </span></a><span class="s0">“How about a side bet?</span>

<a name="l611"><span class="ln">611  </span></a><span class="s0">“What’s in it for the winner?” Emily interjected.</span>
<a name="l612"><span class="ln">612  </span></a><span class="s0">Maddie’s calculating smile took on a slightly evil cast.</span>
<a name="l613"><span class="ln">613  </span></a><span class="s0">Maddie moved two fingers like alligator jaws across James’s hair.</span>
<a name="l614"><span class="ln">614  </span></a><span class="s0">She’d grown attached to the spiky guy.</span>
<a name="l615"><span class="ln">615  </span></a><span class="s0">But James didn’t look worried.</span>
<a name="l616"><span class="ln">616  </span></a><span class="s0">“And if you lose?” he asked.</span>
<a name="l617"><span class="ln">617  </span></a><span class="s0">“You can dye it,” Emily blurted out.</span>
<a name="l618"><span class="ln">618  </span></a><span class="s0">“Red, with white polka dots.</span>
<a name="l619"><span class="ln">619  </span></a><span class="s0">“Like I’m doing that,” Maddie said.</span>
<a name="l620"><span class="ln">620  </span></a><span class="s0">“Way better,” Emily added.</span>
<a name="l621"><span class="ln">621  </span></a><span class="s0">“You can wash the color out the same day.</span>
<a name="l622"><span class="ln">622  </span></a><span class="s0">“What’s Maddie’s problem, anyway?” Emily asked.</span>
<a name="l623"><span class="ln">623  </span></a><span class="s0">“She thinks she’s better than everybody.</span>

<a name="l630"><span class="ln">630  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily bumped her backpack against his.</span>
<a name="l631"><span class="ln">631  </span></a><span class="s0">“You’re a puzzle master!</span>
<a name="l632"><span class="ln">632  </span></a><span class="s0">You’ve got this.</span>
<a name="l633"><span class="ln">633  </span></a><span class="s0">And I’ll help you.</span>
<a name="l634"><span class="ln">634  </span></a><span class="s0">“Visit Bayside Press,” James said.</span>
<a name="l635"><span class="ln">635  </span></a><span class="s0">“This is, like, sacred Book Scavenger territory,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l636"><span class="ln">636  </span></a><span class="s0">The surrounding buildings were dull and serious in comparison.</span>
<a name="l637"><span class="ln">637  </span></a><span class="s0">“Hi,” Emily said when they approached the security guard.</span>
<a name="l638"><span class="ln">638  </span></a><span class="s0">“We’re here to see Joe?” James said hopefully.</span>
<a name="l639"><span class="ln">639  </span></a><span class="s0">The man looked over his glasses at them.</span>
<a name="l640"><span class="ln">640  </span></a><span class="s0">“Joe,” he said.</span>
<a name="l641"><span class="ln">641  </span></a><span class="s0">James nodded confidently.</span>
<a name="l642"><span class="ln">642  </span></a><span class="s0">“The last one?</span>
<a name="l643"><span class="ln">643  </span></a><span class="s0">Joe Young?” The man closed his binder.</span>
<a name="l644"><span class="ln">644  </span></a><span class="s0">“I made him up.</span>
<a name="l645"><span class="ln">645  </span></a><span class="s0">As I suspect you made up your Joe.</span>
<a name="l646"><span class="ln">646  </span></a><span class="s0">Sorry, kids, but this is a business.</span>
<a name="l647"><span class="ln">647  </span></a><span class="s0">Even if they didn’t find an answer to Mr.</span>
<a name="l648"><span class="ln">648  </span></a><span class="s0">“What if I told you we’ve found Mr.</span>
<a name="l649"><span class="ln">649  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s next game?</span>
<a name="l650"><span class="ln">650  </span></a><span class="s0">The security guard barely looked at the book.</span>
<a name="l651"><span class="ln">651  </span></a><span class="s0">“I told them they need an appointment.</span>
<a name="l652"><span class="ln">652  </span></a><span class="s0">They say they’ve found Griswold’s next game, but you know.</span>
<a name="l653"><span class="ln">653  </span></a><span class="s0">We’ve heard that one before.” They’d heard that before?</span>
<a name="l654"><span class="ln">654  </span></a><span class="s0">“I’ve got this,” Jack said to the guard.</span>
<a name="l655"><span class="ln">655  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold?” “And Book Scavenger,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l656"><span class="ln">656  </span></a><span class="s0">“She’s really good at it,” James chimed in.</span>
<a name="l657"><span class="ln">657  </span></a><span class="s0">“Dedicated,” he said.</span>
<a name="l658"><span class="ln">658  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily looked down but smiled.</span>
<a name="l659"><span class="ln">659  </span></a><span class="s0">Still, the compliment and praise were flattering.</span>
<a name="l660"><span class="ln">660  </span></a><span class="s0">“Let me show you guys something.</span>
<a name="l661"><span class="ln">661  </span></a><span class="s0">Come on.” He led them to the elevator.</span>
<a name="l662"><span class="ln">662  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s assistant.” “For real?</span>
<a name="l663"><span class="ln">663  </span></a><span class="s0">You actually work with Mr.</span>
<a name="l664"><span class="ln">664  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold?” James asked.</span>
<a name="l665"><span class="ln">665  </span></a><span class="s0">“Like, every day?” Emily added.</span>
<a name="l666"><span class="ln">666  </span></a><span class="s0">“How’s he doing?” “Ah.” Jack looked down for a minute.</span>
<a name="l667"><span class="ln">667  </span></a><span class="s0">She hugged The Gold-Bug to her chest.</span>
<a name="l668"><span class="ln">668  </span></a><span class="s0">“Whoa,” Emily breathed out.</span>
<a name="l669"><span class="ln">669  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold,” Jack said as they walked.</span>
<a name="l670"><span class="ln">670  </span></a><span class="s0">But no chocolate river or Oompa Loompas here.</span>
<a name="l671"><span class="ln">671  </span></a><span class="s0">“What’s all that?” Emily asked.</span>
<a name="l672"><span class="ln">672  </span></a><span class="s0">“I doubt it,” Jack said.</span>
<a name="l673"><span class="ln">673  </span></a><span class="s0">“I can’t say definitively, of course.</span>
<a name="l674"><span class="ln">674  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold could and he’s—well, he can’t do that right now.</span>
<a name="l675"><span class="ln">675  </span></a><span class="s0">But I do know a couple of absolutes about Mr.</span>
<a name="l676"><span class="ln">676  </span></a><span class="s0">One: His games are rarely simple.</span>
<a name="l677"><span class="ln">677  </span></a><span class="s0">A logistical nightmare to pull off.</span>
<a name="l678"><span class="ln">678  </span></a><span class="s0">“And two: he is highly secretive about his games.</span>
<a name="l679"><span class="ln">679  </span></a><span class="s0">“‘The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett,’” he read aloud.</span>
<a name="l680"><span class="ln">680  </span></a><span class="s0">“Oh, my parents gave me that!” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l681"><span class="ln">681  </span></a><span class="s0">Jack took a moment before he replied.</span>
<a name="l682"><span class="ln">682  </span></a><span class="s0">“Books and games are how people feel close to Mr.</span>
<a name="l683"><span class="ln">683  </span></a><span class="s0">That’s what connects them to him.</span>
<a name="l684"><span class="ln">684  </span></a><span class="s0">They just thought we should know about it.</span>
<a name="l685"><span class="ln">685  </span></a><span class="s0">She really had found Mr.</span>
<a name="l686"><span class="ln">686  </span></a><span class="s0">She wasn’t just hoping it to be true.</span>
<a name="l687"><span class="ln">687  </span></a><span class="s0">It had to be solved.</span>
<a name="l688"><span class="ln">688  </span></a><span class="s0">You don’t think it’s part of the game?” Emily asked.</span>
<a name="l689"><span class="ln">689  </span></a><span class="s0">Jack smiled sadly.</span>
<a name="l690"><span class="ln">690  </span></a><span class="s0">But it doesn’t matter even if I did.</span>
<a name="l691"><span class="ln">691  </span></a><span class="s0">She was glad Jack didn’t believe her about The Gold-Bug.</span>
<a name="l692"><span class="ln">692  </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m glad I happened through the lobby when I did.</span>
<a name="l693"><span class="ln">693  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold was most hopeful about reaching—young, enthusiastic, dedicated.</span>
<a name="l694"><span class="ln">694  </span></a><span class="s0">“I’ve got something else to show you.</span>
<a name="l695"><span class="ln">695  </span></a><span class="s0">She was proofreading a book.</span>
<a name="l696"><span class="ln">696  </span></a><span class="s0">Long, rectangular sheets made up the other stack.</span>
<a name="l697"><span class="ln">697  </span></a><span class="s0">Her dad called them proofs.</span>
<a name="l698"><span class="ln">698  </span></a><span class="s0">“You’re Jack Kerouac?</span>
<a name="l699"><span class="ln">699  </span></a><span class="s0">You’re my dad’s favorite author!</span>
<a name="l700"><span class="ln">700  </span></a><span class="s0">“Ah, well…” She needed to have Jack sign something.</span>
<a name="l701"><span class="ln">701  </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m not the Jack Kerouac,” Jack explained.</span>
<a name="l702"><span class="ln">702  </span></a><span class="s0">“Not the one who wrote On the Road.</span>
<a name="l703"><span class="ln">703  </span></a><span class="s0">He passed away decades ago.</span>
<a name="l704"><span class="ln">704  </span></a><span class="s0">Not that he knew I existed—my father, I mean.</span>
<a name="l705"><span class="ln">705  </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s served me well, though.</span>
<a name="l706"><span class="ln">706  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold got a kick out of it.</span>
<a name="l707"><span class="ln">707  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily knew it at first glance.</span>
<a name="l708"><span class="ln">708  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily could envision Mr.</span>
<a name="l709"><span class="ln">709  </span></a><span class="s0">The man practically leaped forward and extended a hand.</span>
<a name="l710"><span class="ln">710  </span></a><span class="s0">So sorry if I startled you.</span>
<a name="l711"><span class="ln">711  </span></a><span class="s0">I work with Mr.</span>
<a name="l712"><span class="ln">712  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold—at his home, not here at Bayside Press.</span>
<a name="l713"><span class="ln">713  </span></a><span class="s0">But I have his keys, you see?” Mr.</span>
<a name="l714"><span class="ln">714  </span></a><span class="s0">Remora held up a ring of keys and jangled them.</span>
<a name="l715"><span class="ln">715  </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m a rare-book collector.</span>
<a name="l716"><span class="ln">716  </span></a><span class="s0">I work for Mr.</span>
<a name="l717"><span class="ln">717  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold—I said that already, didn’t I?</span>
<a name="l718"><span class="ln">718  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold told me he’d left it in his office.</span>
<a name="l719"><span class="ln">719  </span></a><span class="s0">This book I’m looking for.</span>
<a name="l720"><span class="ln">720  </span></a><span class="s0">Remora the way you might an abstract painting.</span>
<a name="l721"><span class="ln">721  </span></a><span class="s0">I don’t recall doing that.</span>
<a name="l722"><span class="ln">722  </span></a><span class="s0">Absentminded and all that, you know?” Mr.</span>
<a name="l723"><span class="ln">723  </span></a><span class="s0">Remora tapped his skull with his index finger.</span>
<a name="l724"><span class="ln">724  </span></a><span class="s0">“We aren’t allowing anyone in here.” Mr.</span>
<a name="l725"><span class="ln">725  </span></a><span class="s0">Remora’s puppy-dog pleading eyes darkened.</span>
<a name="l726"><span class="ln">726  </span></a><span class="s0">“Aren’t children anyone?” he said.</span>
<a name="l727"><span class="ln">727  </span></a><span class="s0">“That’s enough, Mr.</span>
<a name="l728"><span class="ln">728  </span></a><span class="s0">Remora,” Jack clapped his hands.</span>
<a name="l729"><span class="ln">729  </span></a><span class="s0">“You’ve had your chance to look over these books.</span>
<a name="l730"><span class="ln">730  </span></a><span class="s0">“Sorry about that, guys.</span>
<a name="l731"><span class="ln">731  </span></a><span class="s0">“Is that Edgar Allan Poe?” she asked.</span>
<a name="l732"><span class="ln">732  </span></a><span class="s0">“Impressive!” Jack said.</span>
<a name="l733"><span class="ln">733  </span></a><span class="s0">“It is indeed.</span>
<a name="l734"><span class="ln">734  </span></a><span class="s0">Jack looked quizzically at James, but Emily spoke up.</span>
<a name="l735"><span class="ln">735  </span></a><span class="s0">“He’s a fan of his, then?” “Big-time,” Jack said.</span>
<a name="l736"><span class="ln">736  </span></a><span class="s0">Well, that solved one mystery, at least, Emily thought.</span>
<a name="l737"><span class="ln">737  </span></a><span class="s0">“Why is Poe wearing a necklace?” James asked.</span>
<a name="l738"><span class="ln">738  </span></a><span class="s0">“One of Mr.</span>
<a name="l739"><span class="ln">739  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s most prized possessions,” Jack said.</span>
<a name="l740"><span class="ln">740  </span></a><span class="s0">“Of course you haven’t.</span>
<a name="l741"><span class="ln">741  </span></a><span class="s0">That was a silly question.</span>
<a name="l742"><span class="ln">742  </span></a><span class="s0">He pointed to the necklace.</span>
<a name="l743"><span class="ln">743  </span></a><span class="s0">“A hare, a rabbit.</span>
<a name="l744"><span class="ln">744  </span></a><span class="s0">This was in the seventies.</span>
<a name="l745"><span class="ln">745  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold wasn’t the one to find it originally.</span>
<a name="l746"><span class="ln">746  </span></a><span class="s0">This had to be what Mr.</span>
<a name="l747"><span class="ln">747  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold had planned.</span>
<a name="l748"><span class="ln">748  </span></a><span class="s0">But it spawned a whole genre called armchair treasure hunts.</span>
<a name="l749"><span class="ln">749  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold loved this bit of publishing lore.</span>
<a name="l750"><span class="ln">750  </span></a><span class="s0">It thrilled her to know that.</span>
<a name="l751"><span class="ln">751  </span></a><span class="s0">James wanted to research ciphers for Mr.</span>
<a name="l752"><span class="ln">752  </span></a><span class="s0">“Now what?” Emily muttered, more to herself than anything else.</span>
<a name="l753"><span class="ln">753  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily started copying the letters onto her notebook.</span>
<a name="l754"><span class="ln">754  </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe the word isn’t fort but forth?</span>
<a name="l755"><span class="ln">755  </span></a><span class="s0">“You doubled an o,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l756"><span class="ln">756  </span></a><span class="s0">It’s not to open; it’s topen.</span>
<a name="l757"><span class="ln">757  </span></a><span class="s0">James shook his head.</span>
<a name="l758"><span class="ln">758  </span></a><span class="s0">He gave a welcome speech at that book carnival.</span>
<a name="l759"><span class="ln">759  </span></a><span class="s0">He talks like a regular grown-up.</span>
<a name="l760"><span class="ln">760  </span></a><span class="s0">“That’s it!” Emily pointed to James.</span>
<a name="l761"><span class="ln">761  </span></a><span class="s0">“Me?” his voice squeaked.</span>
<a name="l762"><span class="ln">762  </span></a><span class="s0">“Help,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l763"><span class="ln">763  </span></a><span class="s0">“Here.” She slid her notebook next to the keyboard.</span>
<a name="l764"><span class="ln">764  </span></a><span class="s0">RAVEN: I can’t help you with that.</span>
<a name="l765"><span class="ln">765  </span></a><span class="s0">“Nuts,” James muttered.</span>
<a name="l766"><span class="ln">766  </span></a><span class="s0">You have also located my game assistant, Raven.</span>
<a name="l767"><span class="ln">767  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily blinked at the screen.</span>
<a name="l768"><span class="ln">768  </span></a><span class="s0">She’d done it.</span>
<a name="l769"><span class="ln">769  </span></a><span class="s0">She’d found his next game.</span>
<a name="l770"><span class="ln">770  </span></a><span class="s0">She reread the message again.</span>

<a name="l772"><span class="ln">772  </span></a><span class="s0">GUEST: I think you found my book.</span>
<a name="l773"><span class="ln">773  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily scrunched her nose.</span>
<a name="l774"><span class="ln">774  </span></a><span class="s0">SURLY WOMBAT: What book?</span>
<a name="l775"><span class="ln">775  </span></a><span class="s0">That’s my book.</span>
<a name="l776"><span class="ln">776  </span></a><span class="s0">I need it back.</span>
<a name="l777"><span class="ln">777  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily and James looked at each other.</span>
<a name="l778"><span class="ln">778  </span></a><span class="s0">The Poe book belonged to somebody?</span>
<a name="l779"><span class="ln">779  </span></a><span class="s0">That couldn’t be.</span>
<a name="l780"><span class="ln">780  </span></a><span class="s0">Raven had even confirmed it was part of the game.</span>
<a name="l781"><span class="ln">781  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily was a hundred percent sure the book was Mr.</span>
<a name="l782"><span class="ln">782  </span></a><span class="s0">Which meant that either this mysterious person was Mr.</span>
<a name="l783"><span class="ln">783  </span></a><span class="s0">SURLY WOMBAT: I find a lot of books.</span>
<a name="l784"><span class="ln">784  </span></a><span class="s0">Tell me about yours.</span>
<a name="l785"><span class="ln">785  </span></a><span class="s0">GUEST: It’s by Poe.</span>

<a name="l787"><span class="ln">787  </span></a><span class="s0">GUEST: THE GOLD-BUG.</span>
<a name="l788"><span class="ln">788  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily’s stomach tightened.</span>
<a name="l789"><span class="ln">789  </span></a><span class="s0">James nudged her.</span>
<a name="l790"><span class="ln">790  </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe there’s another collection by that name.</span>
<a name="l791"><span class="ln">791  </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe this is a coincidence,” he said.</span>
<a name="l792"><span class="ln">792  </span></a><span class="s0">SURLY WOMBAT: How many stories?</span>
<a name="l793"><span class="ln">793  </span></a><span class="s0">The cursor blinked endlessly.</span>
<a name="l794"><span class="ln">794  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily held her breath.</span>
<a name="l795"><span class="ln">795  </span></a><span class="s0">SURLY WOMBAT: Sorry.</span>
<a name="l796"><span class="ln">796  </span></a><span class="s0">I don’t think I have your book.</span>
<a name="l797"><span class="ln">797  </span></a><span class="s0">“Sorry,” Barry muttered, and ducked his head.</span>
<a name="l798"><span class="ln">798  </span></a><span class="s0">“You shouldn’t have guessed three,” Clyde said.</span>
<a name="l799"><span class="ln">799  </span></a><span class="s0">“You told me three,” Barry said through gritted teeth.</span>
<a name="l800"><span class="ln">800  </span></a><span class="s0">Man, was he screwed.</span>
<a name="l801"><span class="ln">801  </span></a><span class="s0">This profile gave very little personal information and no photo.</span>
<a name="l802"><span class="ln">802  </span></a><span class="s0">“There we go.” He stabbed the words.</span>
<a name="l803"><span class="ln">803  </span></a><span class="s0">“You okay?” James asked.</span>
<a name="l804"><span class="ln">804  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s had only one.</span>
<a name="l805"><span class="ln">805  </span></a><span class="s0">“That was just weird,” she said.</span>
<a name="l806"><span class="ln">806  </span></a><span class="s0">James nodded his agreement.</span>
<a name="l807"><span class="ln">807  </span></a><span class="s0">“‘One good story deserves another,’” she repeated.</span>
<a name="l808"><span class="ln">808  </span></a><span class="s0">“What could that mean?” The bell rang.</span>
<a name="l809"><span class="ln">809  </span></a><span class="s0">One good story—The Gold-Bug—deserves another … story?</span>
<a name="l810"><span class="ln">810  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily reopened the collection of stories and flipped through it.</span>
<a name="l811"><span class="ln">811  </span></a><span class="s0">“Ready?” James asked, hoisting his backpack onto his shoulders.</span>
<a name="l812"><span class="ln">812  </span></a><span class="s0">The first week of Mr.</span>
<a name="l813"><span class="ln">813  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily didn’t even submit one herself.</span>
<a name="l814"><span class="ln">814  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s game, and her family’s adventures.</span>
<a name="l815"><span class="ln">815  </span></a><span class="s0">“As if I’ll lose!</span>
<a name="l816"><span class="ln">816  </span></a><span class="s0">Have some confidence.” Emily patted Steve on his pointy tips.</span>
<a name="l817"><span class="ln">817  </span></a><span class="s0">“My deepest apologies, Steve!</span>
<a name="l818"><span class="ln">818  </span></a><span class="s0">They approached Hollister’s bookstore.</span>
<a name="l819"><span class="ln">819  </span></a><span class="s0">“Hollister’s in there, talking to someone.</span>
<a name="l820"><span class="ln">820  </span></a><span class="s0">James stopped short, Emily right behind.</span>
<a name="l821"><span class="ln">821  </span></a><span class="s0">This was the same man who had been in Mr.</span>
<a name="l822"><span class="ln">822  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s office last week.</span>
<a name="l823"><span class="ln">823  </span></a><span class="s0">“What is he doing here?” James whispered to Emily.</span>
<a name="l824"><span class="ln">824  </span></a><span class="s0">“No, no, now,” Hollister was saying.</span>
<a name="l825"><span class="ln">825  </span></a><span class="s0">“I said I’d found the Welty we discussed.</span>
<a name="l826"><span class="ln">826  </span></a><span class="s0">I wish you had called first, Leon.</span>
<a name="l827"><span class="ln">827  </span></a><span class="s0">“Ah, James and Emily-Who-Just-Moved-Here.</span>
<a name="l828"><span class="ln">828  </span></a><span class="s0">Just finishing up with my friend, Mr.</span>
<a name="l829"><span class="ln">829  </span></a><span class="s0">In fact, he’s the one I mentioned to you earlier.</span>
<a name="l830"><span class="ln">830  </span></a><span class="s0">The rare-book specialist who works with Mr.</span>
<a name="l831"><span class="ln">831  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold.” To Mr.</span>
<a name="l832"><span class="ln">832  </span></a><span class="s0">It sounded funny to hear Mr.</span>
<a name="l833"><span class="ln">833  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold referred to as a Gary.</span>
<a name="l834"><span class="ln">834  </span></a><span class="s0">Remora barely glanced in their direction.</span>
<a name="l835"><span class="ln">835  </span></a><span class="s0">If he recognized Emily and James, he didn’t show it.</span>
<a name="l836"><span class="ln">836  </span></a><span class="s0">And I tell you what, Leon.</span>
<a name="l837"><span class="ln">837  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily and James pushed around words while they waited.</span>
<a name="l838"><span class="ln">838  </span></a><span class="s0">It reminded Emily of first discovering Mr.</span>
<a name="l839"><span class="ln">839  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s hidden words in The Gold-Bug.</span>
<a name="l840"><span class="ln">840  </span></a><span class="s0">Hollister pulled a pen from the mug by his register.</span>
<a name="l841"><span class="ln">841  </span></a><span class="s0">“So what brings you kids in today?</span>
<a name="l842"><span class="ln">842  </span></a><span class="s0">More book scavenging?” “Oh, um.” Emily glanced at Mr.</span>
<a name="l843"><span class="ln">843  </span></a><span class="s0">“Haven’t thought about that place in years.</span>
<a name="l844"><span class="ln">844  </span></a><span class="s0">That’s where I met Ferlinghetti.” “No,” James interjected.</span>
<a name="l845"><span class="ln">845  </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s not a place.</span>
<a name="l846"><span class="ln">846  </span></a><span class="s0">There was a place called the Black Cat?</span>
<a name="l847"><span class="ln">847  </span></a><span class="s0">Go to the Black Cat.</span>
<a name="l848"><span class="ln">848  </span></a><span class="s0">Remora slapped his hand on the counter three times.</span>
<a name="l849"><span class="ln">849  </span></a><span class="s0">We’re not done here.</span>
<a name="l850"><span class="ln">850  </span></a><span class="s0">“And what about that Carver you had last month?</span>
<a name="l851"><span class="ln">851  </span></a><span class="s0">Is that still here?” “I believe so.</span>
<a name="l852"><span class="ln">852  </span></a><span class="s0">“We can look it up online,” she said.</span>
<a name="l853"><span class="ln">853  </span></a><span class="s0">James called after Hollister’s retreating figure.</span>
<a name="l854"><span class="ln">854  </span></a><span class="s0">“Don’t worry, Hollister!</span>
<a name="l855"><span class="ln">855  </span></a><span class="s0">We’ll google it!”</span>
<a name="l856"><span class="ln">856  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily’s eyes adjusted to the dim interior.</span>
<a name="l857"><span class="ln">857  </span></a><span class="s0">“We’re not here to eat,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l858"><span class="ln">858  </span></a><span class="s0">She sounded like a mouse compared with him.</span>
<a name="l859"><span class="ln">859  </span></a><span class="s0">“We left something,” James said.</span>
<a name="l860"><span class="ln">860  </span></a><span class="s0">“Last night,” Emily added.</span>
<a name="l861"><span class="ln">861  </span></a><span class="s0">“With our families,” James jumped in.</span>
<a name="l862"><span class="ln">862  </span></a><span class="s0">What if there hadn’t been any large groups last night?</span>
<a name="l863"><span class="ln">863  </span></a><span class="s0">“All right, I’ll bite.</span>
<a name="l864"><span class="ln">864  </span></a><span class="s0">What did you leave?” “A, um, book,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l865"><span class="ln">865  </span></a><span class="s0">James poked her in the back.</span>
<a name="l866"><span class="ln">866  </span></a><span class="s0">But she didn’t know how Mr.</span>
<a name="l867"><span class="ln">867  </span></a><span class="s0">Or did they have to find it hidden somewhere?</span>
<a name="l868"><span class="ln">868  </span></a><span class="s0">“I’ve got a cell phone, sunglasses, and an umbrella.</span>
<a name="l869"><span class="ln">869  </span></a><span class="s0">No book.” “Could we look around for it?</span>
<a name="l870"><span class="ln">870  </span></a><span class="s0">We won’t take long,” James said.</span>
<a name="l871"><span class="ln">871  </span></a><span class="s0">“We won’t mess anything up,” Emily added.</span>
<a name="l872"><span class="ln">872  </span></a><span class="s0">“So what are we looking for exactly?” James whispered.</span>
<a name="l873"><span class="ln">873  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily lifted a tablecloth and peered under a table.</span>
<a name="l874"><span class="ln">874  </span></a><span class="s0">“I have no idea,” she said.</span>
<a name="l875"><span class="ln">875  </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m hoping we’ll know it when we see it.</span>
<a name="l876"><span class="ln">876  </span></a><span class="s0">Hollister wasn’t kidding.</span>
<a name="l877"><span class="ln">877  </span></a><span class="s0">They had looked over every inch with no luck.</span>
<a name="l878"><span class="ln">878  </span></a><span class="s0">“You find your book?” he asked without looking up.</span>
<a name="l879"><span class="ln">879  </span></a><span class="s0">“Um, no,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l880"><span class="ln">880  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily hesitantly climbed onto the one next to him.</span>
<a name="l881"><span class="ln">881  </span></a><span class="s0">“Nope,” he said.</span>
<a name="l882"><span class="ln">882  </span></a><span class="s0">“Well, have you read it?” James asked.</span>
<a name="l883"><span class="ln">883  </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s actually an Edgar Allan Poe book we’re looking for.</span>
<a name="l884"><span class="ln">884  </span></a><span class="s0">“So what have you been doing?</span>
<a name="l885"><span class="ln">885  </span></a><span class="s0">You get into the liquor?</span>
<a name="l886"><span class="ln">886  </span></a><span class="s0">“What?” he said with a shake of his head.</span>
<a name="l887"><span class="ln">887  </span></a><span class="s0">“No, I don’t have a clue for you kids.</span>
<a name="l888"><span class="ln">888  </span></a><span class="s0">Go play your game somewhere else, okay?</span>
<a name="l889"><span class="ln">889  </span></a><span class="s0">James had his binder open again to Maddie’s cipher.</span>
<a name="l890"><span class="ln">890  </span></a><span class="s0">Gray buildings, liquor stores.</span>
<a name="l891"><span class="ln">891  </span></a><span class="s0">Its sign read PORTSMOUTH SQUARE.</span>
<a name="l892"><span class="ln">892  </span></a><span class="s0">Bright red pagoda-style awnings covered picnic tables.</span>
<a name="l893"><span class="ln">893  </span></a><span class="s0">“Hey, James.” Emily elbowed him.</span>
<a name="l894"><span class="ln">894  </span></a><span class="s0">“Isn’t that Hollister?” James looked up.</span>
<a name="l895"><span class="ln">895  </span></a><span class="s0">James absentmindedly plucked at Steve.</span>
<a name="l896"><span class="ln">896  </span></a><span class="s0">“Hey, Emily,” he said.</span>
<a name="l897"><span class="ln">897  </span></a><span class="s0">“What if Mr.</span>
<a name="l898"><span class="ln">898  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold never finished his game?</span>
<a name="l899"><span class="ln">899  </span></a><span class="s0">It had to be.</span>
<a name="l900"><span class="ln">900  </span></a><span class="s0">“Well, maybe we should focus on Mr.</span>
<a name="l901"><span class="ln">901  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling’s cipher challenge for a little bit instead.</span>
<a name="l902"><span class="ln">902  </span></a><span class="s0">James gave an apologetic wave.</span>
<a name="l903"><span class="ln">903  </span></a><span class="s0">“Sorry!” “Steve has nothing to worry about,” Emily reassured him.</span>
<a name="l904"><span class="ln">904  </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER 21 IN MR.</span>
<a name="l905"><span class="ln">905  </span></a><span class="s0">He was irritated because he hadn’t cracked Maddie’s code yet.</span>
<a name="l906"><span class="ln">906  </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s only Tuesday,” Emily reassured him.</span>
<a name="l907"><span class="ln">907  </span></a><span class="s0">James smacked Maddie’s finger away from his head.</span>
<a name="l908"><span class="ln">908  </span></a><span class="s0">“What, no plucky retort?” Maddie asked.</span>
<a name="l909"><span class="ln">909  </span></a><span class="s0">James yanked his backpack zipper closed with a ferocious tug.</span>
<a name="l910"><span class="ln">910  </span></a><span class="s0">“She didn’t make it up herself,” James said at lunch.</span>
<a name="l911"><span class="ln">911  </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s an alphabet from the Dark Ages called Ogham.</span>
<a name="l912"><span class="ln">912  </span></a><span class="s0">I found it when I was researching ciphers online.</span>
<a name="l913"><span class="ln">913  </span></a><span class="s0">“She copied it straight out.</span>
<a name="l914"><span class="ln">914  </span></a><span class="s0">If you know Ogham, you’d understand her message.</span>
<a name="l915"><span class="ln">915  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling called over.</span>
<a name="l916"><span class="ln">916  </span></a><span class="s0">Emily’s lips felt dry all of a sudden.</span>
<a name="l917"><span class="ln">917  </span></a><span class="s0">She wasn’t behind on homework.</span>
<a name="l918"><span class="ln">918  </span></a><span class="s0">She hadn’t done anything to get on Mr.</span>
<a name="l919"><span class="ln">919  </span></a><span class="s0">At least she didn’t think she had.</span>
<a name="l920"><span class="ln">920  </span></a><span class="s0">James gave her a questioning look.</span>
<a name="l921"><span class="ln">921  </span></a><span class="s0">Kids filtered in for Mr.</span>
<a name="l922"><span class="ln">922  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling’s seventh period as she approached his desk.</span>
<a name="l923"><span class="ln">923  </span></a><span class="s0">She didn’t know what to say.</span>
<a name="l924"><span class="ln">924  </span></a><span class="s0">She was surprised by all this—Mr.</span>
<a name="l925"><span class="ln">925  </span></a><span class="s0">“Do you remember the book I’m referring to?” Mr.</span>
<a name="l926"><span class="ln">926  </span></a><span class="s0">“Yes,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l927"><span class="ln">927  </span></a><span class="s0">“I hid it again through Book Scavenger.” Mr.</span>
<a name="l928"><span class="ln">928  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling raised his eyebrows.</span>
<a name="l929"><span class="ln">929  </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe he’s wrong.” He frowned.</span>
<a name="l930"><span class="ln">930  </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not another Book Scavenger player trying to trick you.</span>
<a name="l931"><span class="ln">931  </span></a><span class="s0">Remora was a book collector.</span>
<a name="l932"><span class="ln">932  </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold when they walked in on him at Bayside Press.</span>
<a name="l933"><span class="ln">933  </span></a><span class="s0">How many rarebook collectors could there be in San Francisco?</span>
<a name="l934"><span class="ln">934  </span></a><span class="s0">Remora knew about Mr.</span>

<a name="l937"><span class="ln">937  </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling snapped his fingers.</span>

<a name="l939"><span class="ln">939  </span></a><span class="s0">It’s a simple task.</span>
<a name="l940"><span class="ln">940  </span></a><span class="s0">You found a book that belongs to someone else.</span>
<a name="l941"><span class="ln">941  </span></a><span class="s0">Retrieve it and give it back.” Emily nodded.</span>
<a name="l942"><span class="ln">942  </span></a><span class="s0">But she’d already made so much progress with Mr.</span>
<a name="l943"><span class="ln">943  </span></a><span class="s0">It couldn’t hurt to finish it.</span>
<a name="l944"><span class="ln">944  </span></a><span class="s0">That way, Mr.</span>
<a name="l945"><span class="ln">945  </span></a><span class="s0">Everybody would win.</span>
<a name="l946"><span class="ln">946  </span></a><span class="s0">* * * “So what did Mr.</span>

<a name="l1140"><span class="ln">1140 </span></a><span class="s0">But how could they have found them?</span>
<a name="l1141"><span class="ln">1141 </span></a><span class="s0">She replayed that Saturday afternoon: She found Mr.</span>
<a name="l1142"><span class="ln">1142 </span></a><span class="s0">“What?” James eyed her warily.</span>
<a name="l1143"><span class="ln">1143 </span></a><span class="s0">“They found my Book Scavenger card.</span>
<a name="l1144"><span class="ln">1144 </span></a><span class="s0">With my username on it.</span>
<a name="l1145"><span class="ln">1145 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s book?” James repeated.</span>
<a name="l1146"><span class="ln">1146 </span></a><span class="s0">“Don’t you get it?</span>
<a name="l1147"><span class="ln">1147 </span></a><span class="s0">James spoke to his backpack instead of her.</span>
<a name="l1148"><span class="ln">1148 </span></a><span class="s0">Not this again.</span>
<a name="l1149"><span class="ln">1149 </span></a><span class="s0">“It was completed, James.</span>
<a name="l1150"><span class="ln">1150 </span></a><span class="s0">The Black Cat clue led somewhere—don’t you see?</span>
<a name="l1151"><span class="ln">1151 </span></a><span class="s0">That we go to Booker.</span>
<a name="l1152"><span class="ln">1152 </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s not just those men, Emily.</span>
<a name="l1153"><span class="ln">1153 </span></a><span class="s0">Then we found out Mr.</span>
<a name="l1154"><span class="ln">1154 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora needs it.</span>
<a name="l1155"><span class="ln">1155 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s scavenger hunt leads to must be valuable.</span>
<a name="l1156"><span class="ln">1156 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora?” James asked.</span>
<a name="l1157"><span class="ln">1157 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s book, and Mr.</span>
<a name="l1158"><span class="ln">1158 </span></a><span class="s0">“Just admit you want to play his game.</span>
<a name="l1159"><span class="ln">1159 </span></a><span class="s0">She hadn’t helped him with the cipher challenge at all.</span>
<a name="l1160"><span class="ln">1160 </span></a><span class="s0">All that time wasted.</span>
<a name="l1161"><span class="ln">1161 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s game again.</span>
<a name="l1162"><span class="ln">1162 </span></a><span class="s0">I wanted your help.</span>
<a name="l1163"><span class="ln">1163 </span></a><span class="s0">Those men were scary, but something valuable was at stake.</span>
<a name="l1164"><span class="ln">1164 </span></a><span class="s0">Something that mattered to Mr.</span>
<a name="l1165"><span class="ln">1165 </span></a><span class="s0">And that made her determined to get to it first.</span>
<a name="l1166"><span class="ln">1166 </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s important,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l1167"><span class="ln">1167 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s not.” Each word pushed James’s volume up and up.</span>
<a name="l1168"><span class="ln">1168 </span></a><span class="s0">James was right—she hadn’t helped him with Mr.</span>
<a name="l1169"><span class="ln">1169 </span></a><span class="s0">But part of her was upset with him anyway.</span>
<a name="l1170"><span class="ln">1170 </span></a><span class="s0">For her, playing Mr.</span>

<a name="l1172"><span class="ln">1172 </span></a><span class="s0">As she flipped through it, a memory nudged her.</span>
<a name="l1173"><span class="ln">1173 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s next game.</span>
<a name="l1174"><span class="ln">1174 </span></a><span class="s0">The piece Emily was currently trying to figure out.</span>
<a name="l1175"><span class="ln">1175 </span></a><span class="s0">“Matthew,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l1176"><span class="ln">1176 </span></a><span class="s0">Matthew turned, yanking out an earbud.</span>
<a name="l1177"><span class="ln">1177 </span></a><span class="s0">“What’s your problem?” “I need to use the computer.” “Sorry.</span>
<a name="l1178"><span class="ln">1178 </span></a><span class="s0">And it appeared to be taking him forever to finish.</span>
<a name="l1179"><span class="ln">1179 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily jumped back up.</span>
<a name="l1180"><span class="ln">1180 </span></a><span class="s0">“I just want to check on one thing,” she said.</span>
<a name="l1181"><span class="ln">1181 </span></a><span class="s0">“It will be quick.” “Why don’t you ask James?</span>
<a name="l1182"><span class="ln">1182 </span></a><span class="s0">“He doesn’t have a dozen computers,” Emily snapped.</span>
<a name="l1183"><span class="ln">1183 </span></a><span class="s0">“Anyway, this isn’t your computer.</span>
<a name="l1184"><span class="ln">1184 </span></a><span class="s0">“Why are you always so mean?” she exploded.</span>
<a name="l1185"><span class="ln">1185 </span></a><span class="s0">“You used to be fun.</span>
<a name="l1186"><span class="ln">1186 </span></a><span class="s0">“I can take a break.” Matthew saved his work.</span>
<a name="l1187"><span class="ln">1187 </span></a><span class="s0">“Whoa.” She straightened in her seat.</span>
<a name="l1188"><span class="ln">1188 </span></a><span class="s0">Fifty-two copies hidden in San Francisco alone.</span>
<a name="l1189"><span class="ln">1189 </span></a><span class="s0">But it was a big city.</span>
<a name="l1190"><span class="ln">1190 </span></a><span class="s0">There was definitely something going on with The Maltese Falcon.</span>
<a name="l1191"><span class="ln">1191 </span></a><span class="s0">And not just any Book Scavenger player: Raven.</span>
<a name="l1192"><span class="ln">1192 </span></a><span class="s0">SURLY WOMBAT: Who are you?</span>
<a name="l1193"><span class="ln">1193 </span></a><span class="s0">RAVEN: I do not have the information you seek.</span>
<a name="l1194"><span class="ln">1194 </span></a><span class="s0">“Yeah, yeah,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l1195"><span class="ln">1195 </span></a><span class="s0">SURLY WOMBAT: Are you running Mr.</span>
<a name="l1196"><span class="ln">1196 </span></a><span class="s0">RAVEN: I do not have the information you seek.</span>
<a name="l1197"><span class="ln">1197 </span></a><span class="s0">Be coy,” Emily muttered.</span>
<a name="l1198"><span class="ln">1198 </span></a><span class="s0">She looked at the list of hidden Maltese Falcons.</span>
<a name="l1199"><span class="ln">1199 </span></a><span class="s0">She clicked on that.</span>
<a name="l1200"><span class="ln">1200 </span></a><span class="s0">She’d figured it out!</span>
<a name="l1201"><span class="ln">1201 </span></a><span class="s0">That was where she had to go.</span>
<a name="l1202"><span class="ln">1202 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily did a victory spin in the computer chair.</span>
<a name="l1203"><span class="ln">1203 </span></a><span class="s0">She had to tell James.</span>
<a name="l1204"><span class="ln">1204 </span></a><span class="s0">He’d probably even want to go with her.</span>
<a name="l1205"><span class="ln">1205 </span></a><span class="s0">One is at 1155 Leavenworth.</span>
<a name="l1206"><span class="ln">1206 </span></a><span class="s0">And then she waited.</span>
<a name="l1207"><span class="ln">1207 </span></a><span class="s0">There were no footsteps above, no sliding of James’s window.</span>
<a name="l1208"><span class="ln">1208 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily tried the knock again.</span>
<a name="l1209"><span class="ln">1209 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe he wasn’t in his room.</span>
<a name="l1210"><span class="ln">1210 </span></a><span class="s0">Lee opened the door.</span>
<a name="l1211"><span class="ln">1211 </span></a><span class="s0">“Is your apartment on fire?” she asked.</span>
<a name="l1212"><span class="ln">1212 </span></a><span class="s0">For a moment, Emily couldn’t remember why she was there.</span>
<a name="l1213"><span class="ln">1213 </span></a><span class="s0">Is he here?” “One moment,” Ms.</span>
<a name="l1214"><span class="ln">1214 </span></a><span class="s0">Up the staircase she called, “James!</span>
<a name="l1215"><span class="ln">1215 </span></a><span class="s0">Or I could show him your research.” Ms.</span>
<a name="l1216"><span class="ln">1216 </span></a><span class="s0">Lee held out her spoon-free hand.</span>
<a name="l1217"><span class="ln">1217 </span></a><span class="s0">“That’s okay,” Emily said, backing away.</span>
<a name="l1218"><span class="ln">1218 </span></a><span class="s0">I mean Emily.” “What?” She didn’t bother turning around.</span>
<a name="l1219"><span class="ln">1219 </span></a><span class="s0">“I have some free time this week.</span>
<a name="l1220"><span class="ln">1220 </span></a><span class="s0">When she didn’t hear anything, she finally turned.</span>
<a name="l1221"><span class="ln">1221 </span></a><span class="s0">“Okay,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l1222"><span class="ln">1222 </span></a><span class="s0">At Booker she’d started from day one as James’s friend.</span>
<a name="l1223"><span class="ln">1223 </span></a><span class="s0">She didn’t know what role to play anymore.</span>
<a name="l1224"><span class="ln">1224 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily continued outside.</span>
<a name="l1225"><span class="ln">1225 </span></a><span class="s0">Hello, loner girl with her nose in a book.</span>
<a name="l1226"><span class="ln">1226 </span></a><span class="s0">Haven’t seen you in a while, she thought.</span>
<a name="l1227"><span class="ln">1227 </span></a><span class="s0">“Did you?” Mr.</span>
<a name="l1228"><span class="ln">1228 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily looked hers over.</span>
<a name="l1229"><span class="ln">1229 </span></a><span class="s0">Matthew jumped up.</span>
<a name="l1230"><span class="ln">1230 </span></a><span class="s0">“All right, let’s go.</span>
<a name="l1231"><span class="ln">1231 </span></a><span class="s0">“You remembered,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l1232"><span class="ln">1232 </span></a><span class="s0">“Of course, Phlegmily,” he said.</span>
<a name="l1233"><span class="ln">1233 </span></a><span class="s0">Why didn’t he do this with you?” Emily shrugged.</span>
<a name="l1234"><span class="ln">1234 </span></a><span class="s0">“You make a zillion friends every time we move.</span>
<a name="l1235"><span class="ln">1235 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s why you love moving so much.” Matthew snorted.</span>
<a name="l1236"><span class="ln">1236 </span></a><span class="s0">“I don’t love moving.</span>
<a name="l1237"><span class="ln">1237 </span></a><span class="s0">“This is how our life is.</span>
<a name="l1238"><span class="ln">1238 </span></a><span class="s0">Mom and Dad figured it out.” “Were they mad?” “No.</span>
<a name="l1239"><span class="ln">1239 </span></a><span class="s0">“You loved moving back then.</span>
<a name="l1240"><span class="ln">1240 </span></a><span class="s0">Metallic stars dotted the cities where they’d lived.</span>
<a name="l1241"><span class="ln">1241 </span></a><span class="s0">So I decided to just go with it.</span>
<a name="l1242"><span class="ln">1242 </span></a><span class="s0">Matthew was right—you missed out on stuff either way.</span>
<a name="l1243"><span class="ln">1243 </span></a><span class="s0">Or you gained stuff, depending on your perspective.</span>
<a name="l1244"><span class="ln">1244 </span></a><span class="s0">“Do we go in?” Matthew asked.</span>
<a name="l1245"><span class="ln">1245 </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m not sure,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l1246"><span class="ln">1246 </span></a><span class="s0">Matthew tried the front door, but it was locked.</span>
<a name="l1247"><span class="ln">1247 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily studied a fire escape ladder.</span>
<a name="l1248"><span class="ln">1248 </span></a><span class="s0">“Should I climb it?” Matthew asked.</span>
<a name="l1249"><span class="ln">1249 </span></a><span class="s0">Something caught her eye perched high amid the leaves.</span>
<a name="l1250"><span class="ln">1250 </span></a><span class="s0">A large black bird peered down at them.</span>
<a name="l1251"><span class="ln">1251 </span></a><span class="s0">Do birds sleep with their eyes open?</span>
<a name="l1252"><span class="ln">1252 </span></a><span class="s0">Hey, Bird!” “Matthew!” Emily laughed, which only encouraged her brother.</span>
<a name="l1253"><span class="ln">1253 </span></a><span class="s0">“Yeah you, Bird!</span>
<a name="l1254"><span class="ln">1254 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m talking to you!” Still no reaction from the bird.</span>
<a name="l1255"><span class="ln">1255 </span></a><span class="s0">“That is really weird,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l1256"><span class="ln">1256 </span></a><span class="s0">“What kind of bird are you anyway, Bird?” Matthew hollered.</span>
<a name="l1257"><span class="ln">1257 </span></a><span class="s0">“Are you a crow?</span>
<a name="l1258"><span class="ln">1258 </span></a><span class="s0">Or maybe a—” “Raven!” Emily realized.</span>
<a name="l1259"><span class="ln">1259 </span></a><span class="s0">“This is so cool!” Emily exclaimed.</span>
<a name="l1260"><span class="ln">1260 </span></a><span class="s0">“Now that’s a scavenger who went all out.</span>
<a name="l1261"><span class="ln">1261 </span></a><span class="s0">Must be Mr.</span>
<a name="l1262"><span class="ln">1262 </span></a><span class="s0">It looked like an average paperback.</span>
<a name="l1263"><span class="ln">1263 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing written in it.</span>
<a name="l1264"><span class="ln">1264 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing hidden in it.</span>
<a name="l1265"><span class="ln">1265 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s edition of The Gold-Bug.</span>
<a name="l1266"><span class="ln">1266 </span></a><span class="s0">But now she saw it did not.</span>
<a name="l1267"><span class="ln">1267 </span></a><span class="s0">At one point she felt her brother studying her work.</span>
<a name="l1268"><span class="ln">1268 </span></a><span class="s0">She looked over and he pulled out an earbud.</span>
<a name="l1269"><span class="ln">1269 </span></a><span class="s0">“I don’t!” Matthew insisted.</span>
<a name="l1270"><span class="ln">1270 </span></a><span class="s0">It was fun when we used to go book scavenging.</span>
<a name="l1271"><span class="ln">1271 </span></a><span class="s0">Today was fun, too.</span>
<a name="l1272"><span class="ln">1272 </span></a><span class="s0">She’d said Mr.</span>
<a name="l1273"><span class="ln">1273 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s game over the cipher challenge.</span>
<a name="l1274"><span class="ln">1274 </span></a><span class="s0">Or if she used T: ___ ___T___T___ Rotate?</span>
<a name="l1275"><span class="ln">1275 </span></a><span class="s0">Was that even a word?</span>
<a name="l1276"><span class="ln">1276 </span></a><span class="s0">Or A: ___ ___A___A___ Cravat?</span>
<a name="l1277"><span class="ln">1277 </span></a><span class="s0">Those were almost words, but they weren’t spelled right.</span>
<a name="l1278"><span class="ln">1278 </span></a><span class="s0">It was so … quiet and laughless working alone.</span>
<a name="l1279"><span class="ln">1279 </span></a><span class="s0">Interesting form of notetaking, Ms.</span>
<a name="l1280"><span class="ln">1280 </span></a><span class="s0">“Oh!” A bolt of inspiration struck.</span>
<a name="l1281"><span class="ln">1281 </span></a><span class="s0">That was the name.</span>
<a name="l1282"><span class="ln">1282 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe she should even mention this new puzzle.</span>
<a name="l1283"><span class="ln">1283 </span></a><span class="s0">Fingers crossed Babbage would reply to her message.</span>
<a name="l1284"><span class="ln">1284 </span></a><span class="s0">“Tomorrow’s Halloween, Bob,” she said.</span>
<a name="l1285"><span class="ln">1285 </span></a><span class="s0">“Do the kids normally dress up here, Bob?” Bob nodded.</span>
<a name="l1286"><span class="ln">1286 </span></a><span class="s0">“I don’t know if you’re trustworthy, Bob.</span>
<a name="l1287"><span class="ln">1287 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily leaned over her shoulder.</span>
<a name="l1288"><span class="ln">1288 </span></a><span class="s0">“Can I check my messages real quick?” she asked.</span>
<a name="l1289"><span class="ln">1289 </span></a><span class="s0">“No, but you can check them quickly,” her mom replied.</span>
<a name="l1290"><span class="ln">1290 </span></a><span class="s0">Orange lights glowed in the trees.</span>
<a name="l1291"><span class="ln">1291 </span></a><span class="s0">“All yours,” she said.</span>
<a name="l1292"><span class="ln">1292 </span></a><span class="s0">Babbage had replied!</span>
<a name="l1293"><span class="ln">1293 </span></a><span class="s0">I have first period in Room 40.</span>
<a name="l1294"><span class="ln">1294 </span></a><span class="s0">We can talk there.</span>

<a name="l1296"><span class="ln">1296 </span></a><span class="s0">I found another clue.</span>
<a name="l1297"><span class="ln">1297 </span></a><span class="s0">RAVEN: I can’t help you with that.</span>
<a name="l1298"><span class="ln">1298 </span></a><span class="s0">RAVEN: Charlie, Sally, Lucy.</span>
<a name="l1299"><span class="ln">1299 </span></a><span class="s0">“What kind of hint is that?” Emily muttered.</span>
<a name="l1300"><span class="ln">1300 </span></a><span class="s0">Beggars can’t be choosers, though.</span>
<a name="l1301"><span class="ln">1301 </span></a><span class="s0">She’d have to think on this hint a bit more.</span>
<a name="l1302"><span class="ln">1302 </span></a><span class="s0">The hallways were nearly empty.</span>
<a name="l1303"><span class="ln">1303 </span></a><span class="s0">“Oh!” Emily stepped backward.</span>
<a name="l1304"><span class="ln">1304 </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m supposed to meet a student here.” Mr.</span>
<a name="l1305"><span class="ln">1305 </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling set down his pen.</span>
<a name="l1306"><span class="ln">1306 </span></a><span class="s0">He hadn’t dressed up for the holiday.</span>
<a name="l1307"><span class="ln">1307 </span></a><span class="s0">He cracked a smile.</span>
<a name="l1308"><span class="ln">1308 </span></a><span class="s0">“Boo to you, too,” he said.</span>
<a name="l1309"><span class="ln">1309 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily’s face warmed.</span>
<a name="l1310"><span class="ln">1310 </span></a><span class="s0">I like it.</span>
<a name="l1311"><span class="ln">1311 </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s not for school.</span>
<a name="l1312"><span class="ln">1312 </span></a><span class="s0">Before she laid a hand inside, Mr.</span>
<a name="l1313"><span class="ln">1313 </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling cleared his throat.</span>
<a name="l1314"><span class="ln">1314 </span></a><span class="s0">The Gold-Bug sat prominently on top of her notebook.</span>
<a name="l1315"><span class="ln">1315 </span></a><span class="s0">She’d completely forgotten she’d told Mr.</span>
<a name="l1316"><span class="ln">1316 </span></a><span class="s0">“I’ve already seen it.</span>
<a name="l1317"><span class="ln">1317 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s no use trying to hide it,” Mr.</span>
<a name="l1318"><span class="ln">1318 </span></a><span class="s0">“It will be much worse if you lie to me.</span>
<a name="l1319"><span class="ln">1319 </span></a><span class="s0">I am giving it back.</span>
<a name="l1320"><span class="ln">1320 </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling’s mouth formed a thin, tight line.</span>
<a name="l1321"><span class="ln">1321 </span></a><span class="s0">His next words came out very slowly.</span>
<a name="l1322"><span class="ln">1322 </span></a><span class="s0">She couldn’t meet Mr.</span>
<a name="l1323"><span class="ln">1323 </span></a><span class="s0">From the moment she’d met Mr.</span>
<a name="l1324"><span class="ln">1324 </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling, she’d been on his bad side.</span>

<a name="l1333"><span class="ln">1333 </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling’s expressions were like a closet of pressed gray suits.</span>

<a name="l1337"><span class="ln">1337 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold made this book with typos intentionally left inside.</span>
<a name="l1338"><span class="ln">1338 </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling held up a hand.</span>
<a name="l1339"><span class="ln">1339 </span></a><span class="s0">Which is why I don’t want to see it.” Mr.</span>

<a name="l1342"><span class="ln">1342 </span></a><span class="s0">“Then you should understand better than anyone,” Emily pleaded.</span>
<a name="l1343"><span class="ln">1343 </span></a><span class="s0">She couldn’t say the words.</span>

<a name="l1373"><span class="ln">1373 </span></a><span class="s0">A metallic pounding grew louder as Emily approached Hollister’s.</span>
<a name="l1374"><span class="ln">1374 </span></a><span class="s0">Hollister’s door was propped open.</span>
<a name="l1375"><span class="ln">1375 </span></a><span class="s0">“Emily-Who-Just-Moved-Here!” Hollister shouted over the drilling when she entered.</span>
<a name="l1376"><span class="ln">1376 </span></a><span class="s0">“Today’s been a game of Pick Your Poison,” Hollister said.</span>
<a name="l1377"><span class="ln">1377 </span></a><span class="s0">“Suffer through that racket or work in an oven.</span>
<a name="l1378"><span class="ln">1378 </span></a><span class="s0">So what’s new with you?</span>
<a name="l1379"><span class="ln">1379 </span></a><span class="s0">You still enjoying Poe?” Poe.</span>
<a name="l1380"><span class="ln">1380 </span></a><span class="s0">Quisling was probably talking to Mr.</span>
<a name="l1381"><span class="ln">1381 </span></a><span class="s0">“You mind?” he asked, nodding toward the twine.</span>
<a name="l1382"><span class="ln">1382 </span></a><span class="s0">He held the notepad out.</span>
<a name="l1383"><span class="ln">1383 </span></a><span class="s0">“Can’t read my own writing.” Emily leaned forward.</span>
<a name="l1384"><span class="ln">1384 </span></a><span class="s0">“It looks like 2634 Octopus to me,” she read.</span>
<a name="l1385"><span class="ln">1385 </span></a><span class="s0">“Is that for Mr.</span>
<a name="l1386"><span class="ln">1386 </span></a><span class="s0">“How do you know Mr.</span>
<a name="l1387"><span class="ln">1387 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora?” Emily reminded him of that day.</span>
<a name="l1388"><span class="ln">1388 </span></a><span class="s0">“You told us he’s a rare-book specialist and Mr.</span>

<a name="l1390"><span class="ln">1390 </span></a><span class="s0">Indeed, I did.</span>
<a name="l1391"><span class="ln">1391 </span></a><span class="s0">“Do you need help delivering your books?</span>
<a name="l1392"><span class="ln">1392 </span></a><span class="s0">Hollister adjusted his wizard hat.</span>
<a name="l1393"><span class="ln">1393 </span></a><span class="s0">“Isn’t that kind of you.</span>
<a name="l1394"><span class="ln">1394 </span></a><span class="s0">Thank you, doll.</span>
<a name="l1395"><span class="ln">1395 </span></a><span class="s0">Too young to be my employee for one.</span>
<a name="l1396"><span class="ln">1396 </span></a><span class="s0">Hollister watched her push magnetic words.</span>
<a name="l1397"><span class="ln">1397 </span></a><span class="s0">“You know,” he said.</span>

<a name="l1402"><span class="ln">1402 </span></a><span class="s0">Both seemed like good people.</span>
<a name="l1403"><span class="ln">1403 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold in a time of need.</span>
<a name="l1404"><span class="ln">1404 </span></a><span class="s0">Have you talked to Mr.</span>
<a name="l1405"><span class="ln">1405 </span></a><span class="s0">“I don’t like thinking about that,” she said.</span>
<a name="l1406"><span class="ln">1406 </span></a><span class="s0">But then he said, “Gary was young.</span>

<a name="l1408"><span class="ln">1408 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s, too?” She envisioned Mr.</span>

<a name="l1411"><span class="ln">1411 </span></a><span class="s0">But—also like Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Peter Martin—our partnership eventually severed.</span>
<a name="l1412"><span class="ln">1412 </span></a><span class="s0">Ours less amicably, I’m afraid.” “Why?” “Similar interests, different priorities.</span>
<a name="l1413"><span class="ln">1413 </span></a><span class="s0">Money changes your circumstances, but it can’t change your core.</span>

<a name="l1415"><span class="ln">1415 </span></a><span class="s0">“That’s bound to happen.</span>
<a name="l1416"><span class="ln">1416 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily took a deep breath.</span>
<a name="l1417"><span class="ln">1417 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s no ‘how’ about it.</span>
<a name="l1418"><span class="ln">1418 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s all a good friend is.</span>
<a name="l1419"><span class="ln">1419 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s what Gary did for me.</span>

<a name="l1423"><span class="ln">1423 </span></a><span class="s0">The fake smile disappeared.</span>
<a name="l1424"><span class="ln">1424 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily clenched fists around her backpack straps.</span>

<a name="l1434"><span class="ln">1434 </span></a><span class="s0">“No,” he repeated, more calmly.</span>
<a name="l1435"><span class="ln">1435 </span></a><span class="s0">The problem was, she really didn’t have the book.</span>
<a name="l1436"><span class="ln">1436 </span></a><span class="s0">And what would they do if they didn’t believe her?</span>
<a name="l1437"><span class="ln">1437 </span></a><span class="s0">She couldn’t outrun them.</span>
<a name="l1438"><span class="ln">1438 </span></a><span class="s0">Her only choice was to outsmart them.</span>
<a name="l1439"><span class="ln">1439 </span></a><span class="s0">An idea came to her, but it was risky.</span>

<a name="l1468"><span class="ln">1468 </span></a><span class="s0">He walked away.</span>

<a name="l1623"><span class="ln">1623 </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m fine,” Emily gasped, although her vision was spinning.</span>
<a name="l1624"><span class="ln">1624 </span></a><span class="s0">“Emily?” That was James crouching next to her.</span>

<a name="l1635"><span class="ln">1635 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora threw his hands in the air.</span>
<a name="l1636"><span class="ln">1636 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora closed the front door and flipped the dead bolt.</span>

<a name="l1644"><span class="ln">1644 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora twisted the dead bolt and tugged the door open.</span>
<a name="l1645"><span class="ln">1645 </span></a><span class="s0">“Took you long enough, Clyde,” he snapped.</span>
<a name="l1646"><span class="ln">1646 </span></a><span class="s0">Barry stepped forward.</span>
<a name="l1647"><span class="ln">1647 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora said impatiently.</span>

<a name="l1655"><span class="ln">1655 </span></a><span class="s0">You wouldn’t be interested in the prize anyway.</span>
<a name="l1656"><span class="ln">1656 </span></a><span class="s0">“Why else would I go to this trouble?</span>

<a name="l1682"><span class="ln">1682 </span></a><span class="s0">“You forgot this,” James said.</span>
<a name="l1683"><span class="ln">1683 </span></a><span class="s0">Then in their cipher language James wrote Now!</span>
<a name="l1684"><span class="ln">1684 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora, getting the American Revolution books wet in the process.</span>
<a name="l1685"><span class="ln">1685 </span></a><span class="s0">“What the—” Barry sputtered, startled from his nap.</span>
<a name="l1686"><span class="ln">1686 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora spun this way and that, uncertain where to go.</span>

<a name="l1701"><span class="ln">1701 </span></a><span class="s0">This was Trevor, the drummer of Flush.</span>
<a name="l1702"><span class="ln">1702 </span></a><span class="s0">“Sorry we crashed your bus,” James said.</span>
<a name="l1703"><span class="ln">1703 </span></a><span class="s0">“At least I’m not.</span>
<a name="l1704"><span class="ln">1704 </span></a><span class="s0">I mean, no offense.</span>
<a name="l1705"><span class="ln">1705 </span></a><span class="s0">“Sorry,” he said.</span>
<a name="l1706"><span class="ln">1706 </span></a><span class="s0">Trevor chewed on his lip piercing while he studied them.</span>
<a name="l1707"><span class="ln">1707 </span></a><span class="s0">“Do these two talk?” he asked James.</span>
<a name="l1708"><span class="ln">1708 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily dropped her hands from her mouth.</span>
<a name="l1709"><span class="ln">1709 </span></a><span class="s0">“Sorry,” she said meekly.</span>
<a name="l1710"><span class="ln">1710 </span></a><span class="s0">“My brother is seriously your number one fan.</span>
<a name="l1711"><span class="ln">1711 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not normally like this.” Matthew sputtered, “Five … FiveSpade.</span>
<a name="l1712"><span class="ln">1712 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m FiveSpade.” Trevor raised his eyebrows.</span>
<a name="l1713"><span class="ln">1713 </span></a><span class="s0">I thought you’d be older.</span>
<a name="l1714"><span class="ln">1714 </span></a><span class="s0">No offense, man, but that LEGO Domination video was sick.</span>
<a name="l1715"><span class="ln">1715 </span></a><span class="s0">“Man, this is a trip!” Trevor said.</span>
<a name="l1716"><span class="ln">1716 </span></a><span class="s0">He went to the curtain and called behind it.</span>
<a name="l1717"><span class="ln">1717 </span></a><span class="s0">“Zeke!” Matthew said.</span>
<a name="l1718"><span class="ln">1718 </span></a><span class="s0">“’Sup.” Trevor gripped his arm.</span>
<a name="l1719"><span class="ln">1719 </span></a><span class="s0">“Zeke—guess who this is.” Zeke looked Matthew up and down.</span>
<a name="l1720"><span class="ln">1720 </span></a><span class="s0">“Liam’s cousin?” he said.</span>
<a name="l1721"><span class="ln">1721 </span></a><span class="s0">Can you believe it?” “LEGO Domination?” Zeke nodded.</span>
<a name="l1722"><span class="ln">1722 </span></a><span class="s0">James stared out the window.</span>
<a name="l1723"><span class="ln">1723 </span></a><span class="s0">“See anything?” she asked.</span>
<a name="l1724"><span class="ln">1724 </span></a><span class="s0">He shook his head.</span>
<a name="l1725"><span class="ln">1725 </span></a><span class="s0">“They haven’t come down the street.</span>
<a name="l1726"><span class="ln">1726 </span></a><span class="s0">We lost them.” They’d gotten away.</span>
<a name="l1727"><span class="ln">1727 </span></a><span class="s0">Neil opened the mini fridge and tossed around sodas.</span>
<a name="l1728"><span class="ln">1728 </span></a><span class="s0">But don’t call it ’Frisco.</span>
<a name="l1729"><span class="ln">1729 </span></a><span class="s0">Gently, she ran her fingers over the top.</span>
<a name="l1730"><span class="ln">1730 </span></a><span class="s0">“What do you see?” James whispered.</span>
<a name="l1731"><span class="ln">1731 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily shook her head.</span>
<a name="l1732"><span class="ln">1732 </span></a><span class="s0">“Nothing.” She opened the cover and scrutinized the inside scarab.</span>
<a name="l1733"><span class="ln">1733 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe she was wrong.</span>
<a name="l1734"><span class="ln">1734 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily sagged at the thought of this.</span>
<a name="l1735"><span class="ln">1735 </span></a><span class="s0">What would Mr.</span>
<a name="l1736"><span class="ln">1736 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora have done if they hadn’t escaped?</span>
<a name="l1737"><span class="ln">1737 </span></a><span class="s0">“Could I borrow that?” Liam looked scandalized.</span>
<a name="l1738"><span class="ln">1738 </span></a><span class="s0">“You can’t smoke!” Emily blushed.</span>
<a name="l1739"><span class="ln">1739 </span></a><span class="s0">“Like this?” he asked her.</span>
<a name="l1740"><span class="ln">1740 </span></a><span class="s0">“Too close!” Trevor yelled, noticing what Liam was doing.</span>
<a name="l1741"><span class="ln">1741 </span></a><span class="s0">Liam jerked his hand back in surprise.</span>
<a name="l1742"><span class="ln">1742 </span></a><span class="s0">The guys in the bus erupted in laughter.</span>
<a name="l1743"><span class="ln">1743 </span></a><span class="s0">“Sorry,” Liam said with a grin.</span>
<a name="l1744"><span class="ln">1744 </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s okay,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l1745"><span class="ln">1745 </span></a><span class="s0">“I was right!” Emily waved Liam back to the book.</span>
<a name="l1746"><span class="ln">1746 </span></a><span class="s0">There must be invisible ink on this page.</span>
<a name="l1747"><span class="ln">1747 </span></a><span class="s0">We have to go there!” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l1748"><span class="ln">1748 </span></a><span class="s0">“Right now?” Matthew asked.</span>
<a name="l1749"><span class="ln">1749 </span></a><span class="s0">“I don’t know, Em,” James said.</span>
<a name="l1750"><span class="ln">1750 </span></a><span class="s0">It must be.</span>
<a name="l1751"><span class="ln">1751 </span></a><span class="s0">This is the treasure map that marks the spot.</span>
<a name="l1752"><span class="ln">1752 </span></a><span class="s0">We lost Mr.</span>
<a name="l1753"><span class="ln">1753 </span></a><span class="s0">If we do this tonight, we solve Mr.</span>
<a name="l1754"><span class="ln">1754 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora, too.” James tugged thoughtfully at Steve, considering all this.</span>
<a name="l1755"><span class="ln">1755 </span></a><span class="s0">“Don’t you want to see what Mr.</span>
<a name="l1756"><span class="ln">1756 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s treasure will be?” Finally he nodded.</span>
<a name="l1757"><span class="ln">1757 </span></a><span class="s0">She stood up from the booth.</span>
<a name="l1758"><span class="ln">1758 </span></a><span class="s0">“We’re leaving now,” she said.</span>
<a name="l1759"><span class="ln">1759 </span></a><span class="s0">“Tonight?” Matthew asked.</span>
<a name="l1760"><span class="ln">1760 </span></a><span class="s0">“You don’t have to go,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l1761"><span class="ln">1761 </span></a><span class="s0">Finally, he shook his head.</span>
<a name="l1762"><span class="ln">1762 </span></a><span class="s0">He turned to Emily.</span>
<a name="l1763"><span class="ln">1763 </span></a><span class="s0">“But I’m not letting you two go off by yourselves.</span>
<a name="l1764"><span class="ln">1764 </span></a><span class="s0">There’ll be more concerts.</span>
<a name="l1765"><span class="ln">1765 </span></a><span class="s0">“You’re a good bro, bro.</span>
<a name="l1766"><span class="ln">1766 </span></a><span class="s0">We’re heading backstage in a minute here.</span>
<a name="l1767"><span class="ln">1767 </span></a><span class="s0">A fog had descended on this part of the city.</span>
<a name="l1768"><span class="ln">1768 </span></a><span class="s0">“Do you know anything about this place?” Emily asked James.</span>
<a name="l1769"><span class="ln">1769 </span></a><span class="s0">“They call it the heart of Chinatown.</span>
<a name="l1770"><span class="ln">1770 </span></a><span class="s0">“So what are we looking for?” Matthew asked.</span>
<a name="l1771"><span class="ln">1771 </span></a><span class="s0">“Is that a pirate ship?” Emily asked.</span>
<a name="l1772"><span class="ln">1772 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily trailed her fingers over the engraving.</span>
<a name="l1773"><span class="ln">1773 </span></a><span class="s0">“Here.” Matthew whipped out his cell phone.</span>
<a name="l1774"><span class="ln">1774 </span></a><span class="s0">He cast the light of the screen over the words.</span>
<a name="l1775"><span class="ln">1775 </span></a><span class="s0">“Watch the poster!” Matthew said, shaking her off.</span>
<a name="l1776"><span class="ln">1776 </span></a><span class="s0">“The map said RLS—Robert Louis Stevenson!</span>
<a name="l1777"><span class="ln">1777 </span></a><span class="s0">He wrote Treasure Island.</span>
<a name="l1778"><span class="ln">1778 </span></a><span class="s0">This has to be it.</span>
<a name="l1779"><span class="ln">1779 </span></a><span class="s0">James inspected the nearby benches.</span>
<a name="l1780"><span class="ln">1780 </span></a><span class="s0">She ran her fingers through the grass.</span>
<a name="l1781"><span class="ln">1781 </span></a><span class="s0">Her fingertips brushed over something cold and smooth.</span>
<a name="l1782"><span class="ln">1782 </span></a><span class="s0">She thought it was a pebble, but it wouldn’t budge.</span>
<a name="l1783"><span class="ln">1783 </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s like the story,” Emily said.</span>
<a name="l1784"><span class="ln">1784 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold wanted them to find.</span>
<a name="l1785"><span class="ln">1785 </span></a><span class="s0">James tried to lift the beetle but couldn’t.</span>
<a name="l1786"><span class="ln">1786 </span></a><span class="s0">It was attached to a stake in the ground.</span>
<a name="l1787"><span class="ln">1787 </span></a><span class="s0">The bottom of the stake widened into a mini shovel.</span>
<a name="l1788"><span class="ln">1788 </span></a><span class="s0">“Dig!” James said.</span>
<a name="l1789"><span class="ln">1789 </span></a><span class="s0">They pried the box from the ground.</span>
<a name="l1790"><span class="ln">1790 </span></a><span class="s0">Edgar Allan Poe.</span>
<a name="l1791"><span class="ln">1791 </span></a><span class="s0">Rufus Griswold was an accomplished editor, poet, and critic.</span>
<a name="l1792"><span class="ln">1792 </span></a><span class="s0">Sadly, you would be mistaken.</span>
<a name="l1793"><span class="ln">1793 </span></a><span class="s0">“There goes the battery,” he said.</span>
<a name="l1794"><span class="ln">1794 </span></a><span class="s0">“I have no idea,” Emily said quietly.</span>
<a name="l1795"><span class="ln">1795 </span></a><span class="s0">“I do,” a voice said behind them.</span>
<a name="l1796"><span class="ln">1796 </span></a><span class="s0">“Hand that over,” Mr.</span>
<a name="l1797"><span class="ln">1797 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora said, extending his hand.</span>
<a name="l1798"><span class="ln">1798 </span></a><span class="s0">Barry and Clyde stood behind him.</span>
<a name="l1799"><span class="ln">1799 </span></a><span class="s0">“You guys again?” Emily hugged the bagged manuscript.</span>
<a name="l1800"><span class="ln">1800 </span></a><span class="s0">“How did you find us?” James asked.</span>
<a name="l1801"><span class="ln">1801 </span></a><span class="s0">“You didn’t think you fooled me, did you?</span>
<a name="l1802"><span class="ln">1802 </span></a><span class="s0">Hiding on that tour bus?</span>
<a name="l1803"><span class="ln">1803 </span></a><span class="s0">“How did you know about it, anyway?” Emily asked.</span>
<a name="l1804"><span class="ln">1804 </span></a><span class="s0">She scanned the park for an escape route.</span>
<a name="l1805"><span class="ln">1805 </span></a><span class="s0">An iron fence enclosed the area.</span>
<a name="l1806"><span class="ln">1806 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora and his goons for the second time that night.</span>
<a name="l1807"><span class="ln">1807 </span></a><span class="s0">“I’ve worked for that man for a long time.</span>
<a name="l1808"><span class="ln">1808 </span></a><span class="s0">And he didn’t find the lost Poe manuscript.</span>
<a name="l1809"><span class="ln">1809 </span></a><span class="s0">Of course not.</span>
<a name="l1810"><span class="ln">1810 </span></a><span class="s0">We should have been partners.</span>
<a name="l1811"><span class="ln">1811 </span></a><span class="s0">A fifty-fifty split.</span>
<a name="l1812"><span class="ln">1812 </span></a><span class="s0">“Then Garrison planned this cockamamie game without consulting me.</span>
<a name="l1813"><span class="ln">1813 </span></a><span class="s0">Matthew shook his head and stepped back.</span>
<a name="l1814"><span class="ln">1814 </span></a><span class="s0">“He said, ‘Oh, but you will be a partner, Leon.</span>
<a name="l1815"><span class="ln">1815 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold wouldn’t have been that mean.</span>
<a name="l1816"><span class="ln">1816 </span></a><span class="s0">That work deserves to be in a museum!</span>
<a name="l1817"><span class="ln">1817 </span></a><span class="s0">“And my hands are clean,” Emily added nervously.</span>
<a name="l1818"><span class="ln">1818 </span></a><span class="s0">“You’ll cut it up for paper dolls!” Mr.</span>
<a name="l1819"><span class="ln">1819 </span></a><span class="s0">“Hey now, Uncle Leon,” Barry said.</span>
<a name="l1820"><span class="ln">1820 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora whipped a finger toward him.</span>
<a name="l1821"><span class="ln">1821 </span></a><span class="s0">“You don’t get a say in this.</span>
<a name="l1822"><span class="ln">1822 </span></a><span class="s0">I trusted you with entirely too much.</span>
<a name="l1823"><span class="ln">1823 </span></a><span class="s0">This child has been more resourceful than you, Barry.</span>
<a name="l1824"><span class="ln">1824 </span></a><span class="s0">You lose money that’s not yours on horse races.</span>
<a name="l1825"><span class="ln">1825 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily’s eyes flicked from Mr.</span>
<a name="l1826"><span class="ln">1826 </span></a><span class="s0">Barry shifted from side to side, eyeing Mr.</span>
<a name="l1827"><span class="ln">1827 </span></a><span class="s0">“Garrison Griswold was a fraud!</span>
<a name="l1828"><span class="ln">1828 </span></a><span class="s0">Her sudden movement alarmed Mr.</span>
<a name="l1829"><span class="ln">1829 </span></a><span class="s0">“Dude,” Matthew said.</span>
<a name="l1830"><span class="ln">1830 </span></a><span class="s0">“I thought you threw that away!” Barry cried.</span>
<a name="l1831"><span class="ln">1831 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s current uncertain state, followed by a tsunami of anger.</span>
<a name="l1832"><span class="ln">1832 </span></a><span class="s0">“You shot him over a book?</span>
<a name="l1833"><span class="ln">1833 </span></a><span class="s0">How could you do that?</span>
<a name="l1834"><span class="ln">1834 </span></a><span class="s0">He did nothing but positive things!</span>
<a name="l1835"><span class="ln">1835 </span></a><span class="s0">He might die now, and for what?</span>
<a name="l1836"><span class="ln">1836 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold’s game was over.</span>
<a name="l1837"><span class="ln">1837 </span></a><span class="s0">He was still in critical condition.</span>
<a name="l1838"><span class="ln">1838 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold might die, and Book Scavenger might die with him.</span>
<a name="l1839"><span class="ln">1839 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing would change any of that.</span>
<a name="l1840"><span class="ln">1840 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily leveled her eyes at the three men.</span>
<a name="l1841"><span class="ln">1841 </span></a><span class="s0">“You are pathetic.” “He shot him, not me.” Mr.</span>
<a name="l1842"><span class="ln">1842 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora pointed to Clyde.</span>
<a name="l1843"><span class="ln">1843 </span></a><span class="s0">“But it had to be done.</span>
<a name="l1844"><span class="ln">1844 </span></a><span class="s0">As it stands now, nobody knows it exists.</span>
<a name="l1845"><span class="ln">1845 </span></a><span class="s0">It can be my discovery.</span>
<a name="l1846"><span class="ln">1846 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora rumpled his hair, looking suddenly uncomfortable.</span>
<a name="l1847"><span class="ln">1847 </span></a><span class="s0">Unfortunately, Barry did, too, and got to the gun first.</span>
<a name="l1848"><span class="ln">1848 </span></a><span class="s0">The dreadlocks would have been recognizable anywhere.</span>
<a name="l1849"><span class="ln">1849 </span></a><span class="s0">“Hollister?” Emily asked.</span>
<a name="l1850"><span class="ln">1850 </span></a><span class="s0">Barry swung the gun back and forth.</span>
<a name="l1851"><span class="ln">1851 </span></a><span class="s0">“Don’t stand there, idiot.</span>
<a name="l1852"><span class="ln">1852 </span></a><span class="s0">Do something,” Mr.</span>
<a name="l1853"><span class="ln">1853 </span></a><span class="s0">“What am I supposed to do?” Barry shouted.</span>
<a name="l1854"><span class="ln">1854 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora jabbed a finger in Emily’s direction, punctuating every word.</span>
<a name="l1855"><span class="ln">1855 </span></a><span class="s0">Manuscript.” Hollister remained crouched next to the unconscious Clyde.</span>
<a name="l1856"><span class="ln">1856 </span></a><span class="s0">“Leon, get a hold of yourself,” Hollister said.</span>
<a name="l1857"><span class="ln">1857 </span></a><span class="s0">“You stay out of this!” Mr.</span>
<a name="l1858"><span class="ln">1858 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora didn’t even look Hollister’s way.</span>
<a name="l1859"><span class="ln">1859 </span></a><span class="s0">“Hand me the gun, Barry.” “They’re just kids,” Barry said.</span>
<a name="l1860"><span class="ln">1860 </span></a><span class="s0">Barry swung the gun toward Matthew.</span>
<a name="l1861"><span class="ln">1861 </span></a><span class="s0">Emily pressed the manuscript even more tightly to her chest.</span>
<a name="l1862"><span class="ln">1862 </span></a><span class="s0">“He’s using you, man,” Matthew said.</span>
<a name="l1863"><span class="ln">1863 </span></a><span class="s0">“He doesn’t care about you.</span>
<a name="l1864"><span class="ln">1864 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora said in a calm, even voice.</span>
<a name="l1865"><span class="ln">1865 </span></a><span class="s0">“That’s not true.</span>
<a name="l1866"><span class="ln">1866 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re my flesh and blood.</span>
<a name="l1867"><span class="ln">1867 </span></a><span class="s0">“Five hundred dollars,” Barry muttered.</span>
<a name="l1868"><span class="ln">1868 </span></a><span class="s0">“That’s all?” Matthew said.</span>
<a name="l1869"><span class="ln">1869 </span></a><span class="s0">“You don’t care about me,” Barry said.</span>
<a name="l1870"><span class="ln">1870 </span></a><span class="s0">At the moment, Mr.</span>
<a name="l1871"><span class="ln">1871 </span></a><span class="s0">Griswold had no respect for literary treasures.</span>
<a name="l1872"><span class="ln">1872 </span></a><span class="s0">He was a savage!</span>
<a name="l1873"><span class="ln">1873 </span></a><span class="s0">He buried that manuscript in the ground!</span>
<a name="l1874"><span class="ln">1874 </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m so sorry I didn’t get to you kids before.</span>
<a name="l1875"><span class="ln">1875 </span></a><span class="s0">“Did you know about the game?</span>
<a name="l1876"><span class="ln">1876 </span></a><span class="s0">You knew it ended here?” “Yes and no,” Hollister said.</span>
<a name="l1877"><span class="ln">1877 </span></a><span class="s0">It became quite the phenomenon, and Gary was inspired.</span>
<a name="l1878"><span class="ln">1878 </span></a><span class="s0">Those were the pieces of his plans that I knew.</span>
<a name="l1879"><span class="ln">1879 </span></a><span class="s0">But it doesn’t surprise me.</span>
<a name="l1880"><span class="ln">1880 </span></a><span class="s0">I decided to keep an eye on the place.</span>
<a name="l1881"><span class="ln">1881 </span></a><span class="s0">“I have to apologize to you kids,” Hollister said.</span>
<a name="l1882"><span class="ln">1882 </span></a><span class="s0">“I thought this would be a harmless game.</span>
<a name="l1883"><span class="ln">1883 </span></a><span class="s0">I didn’t realize Mr.</span>
<a name="l1884"><span class="ln">1884 </span></a><span class="s0">Remora or anyone else was involved.</span>
<a name="l1885"><span class="ln">1885 </span></a><span class="s0">You get what he was all about.</span>

<a name="l4721"><span class="ln">4721 </span></a><span class="s0">There are also birdlife such as eagles, herons, and vultures.</span>
<a name="l4722"><span class="ln">4722 </span></a><span class="s0">Additional national parks and resorts have been discussed below.</span>
<a name="l4723"><span class="ln">4723 </span></a><span class="s0">The Meru National Park is a natural habitat.</span>
<a name="l4724"><span class="ln">4724 </span></a><span class="s0">The accompanying resorts are positioned along the equatorial region.</span>
<a name="l4725"><span class="ln">4725 </span></a><span class="s0">It hosts crocodile and elephants alongside other rare animal species.</span>
<a name="l4726"><span class="ln">4726 </span></a><span class="s0">The latter are a home to lions, zebras and rhinos.</span>
<a name="l4727"><span class="ln">4727 </span></a><span class="s0">Some of the conservancies include the Olare Motorogi and Naboisho.</span>
<a name="l4728"><span class="ln">4728 </span></a><span class="s0">Generally, wildlife has vast space for reproduction and habitation.</span>
<a name="l4729"><span class="ln">4729 </span></a><span class="s0">Huge hunting safaris were undertaken by these visitors.</span>
<a name="l4730"><span class="ln">4730 </span></a><span class="s0">In the process, wildlife was slaughtered in mass numbers.</span>
<a name="l4731"><span class="ln">4731 </span></a><span class="s0">Consequently, additional protected areas were established.</span>
<a name="l4732"><span class="ln">4732 </span></a><span class="s0">About 12 months later, the Nairobi Royal Park was incepted.</span>
<a name="l4733"><span class="ln">4733 </span></a><span class="s0">These goals are presumably not within the protected areas.</span>
<a name="l4734"><span class="ln">4734 </span></a><span class="s0">The following section will discuss these challenges in details.</span>
<a name="l4735"><span class="ln">4735 </span></a><span class="s0">Several types of fish species have consequently been endangered.</span>
<a name="l4736"><span class="ln">4736 </span></a><span class="s0">Hence, road transport can hardly be used in such locations.</span>
<a name="l4737"><span class="ln">4737 </span></a><span class="s0">Undoubtedly, a weak security platform is may scare tourists.</span>
<a name="l4738"><span class="ln">4738 </span></a><span class="s0">They assert that the world is experiencing variability in climate.</span>
<a name="l4739"><span class="ln">4739 </span></a><span class="s0">Excessive evaporation eventually leads to heavy condensation and precipitation.</span>
<a name="l4740"><span class="ln">4740 </span></a><span class="s0">Tourist resorts are vital facilities in national parks.</span>
<a name="l4741"><span class="ln">4741 </span></a><span class="s0">This type of resort has enough capabilities to accommodate visitors.</span>
<a name="l4742"><span class="ln">4742 </span></a><span class="s0">This is yet another challenge facing national habituates in Kenya.</span>
<a name="l4743"><span class="ln">4743 </span></a><span class="s0">This condition is sometimes accompanied by rapid spread of infections.</span>
<a name="l4744"><span class="ln">4744 </span></a><span class="s0">How can National parks in Kenya transfer to successful businesses?</span>
<a name="l4745"><span class="ln">4745 </span></a><span class="s0">This type of resort has enough capabilities to accommodate visitors.</span>
<a name="l4746"><span class="ln">4746 </span></a><span class="s0">these resorts are not merely places of accommodation.</span>
<a name="l4747"><span class="ln">4747 </span></a><span class="s0">Some Kenyan national parks also lack sufficient road network.</span>
<a name="l4748"><span class="ln">4748 </span></a><span class="s0">The tourism sector is quite dynamic.</span>
<a name="l4749"><span class="ln">4749 </span></a><span class="s0">For example, Ksh.</span>
<a name="l4750"><span class="ln">4750 </span></a><span class="s0">It stimulates cross cultural understanding across various cultures.</span>
<a name="l4751"><span class="ln">4751 </span></a><span class="s0">Unique water sports include fishing and whitewater rafting.</span>
<a name="l4752"><span class="ln">4752 </span></a><span class="s0">Nu human input is required to create wildlife.</span>
<a name="l4753"><span class="ln">4753 </span></a><span class="s0">We received and encountered more than we expected.</span>
<a name="l4754"><span class="ln">4754 </span></a><span class="s0">When natural resources are scarce, conflicts usually arise.</span>
<a name="l4755"><span class="ln">4755 </span></a><span class="s0">The result is the conflict between the two.</span>
<a name="l4756"><span class="ln">4756 </span></a><span class="s0">Out of these tribes, about five are the most dominant.</span>

<a name="l5060"><span class="ln">5060 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston made for the stairs.</span>
<a name="l5061"><span class="ln">5061 </span></a><span class="s0">It was no use trying the lift.</span>
<a name="l5062"><span class="ln">5062 </span></a><span class="s0">BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.</span>
<a name="l5063"><span class="ln">5063 </span></a><span class="s0">Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold.</span>
<a name="l5064"><span class="ln">5064 </span></a><span class="s0">The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner.</span>
<a name="l5065"><span class="ln">5065 </span></a><span class="s0">There was one on the house-front immediately opposite.</span>
<a name="l5066"><span class="ln">5066 </span></a><span class="s0">It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows.</span>
<a name="l5067"><span class="ln">5067 </span></a><span class="s0">Only the Thought Police mattered.</span>
<a name="l5068"><span class="ln">5068 </span></a><span class="s0">The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously.</span>
<a name="l5069"><span class="ln">5069 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen.</span>
<a name="l5070"><span class="ln">5070 </span></a><span class="s0">The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war.</span>
<a name="l5071"><span class="ln">5071 </span></a><span class="s0">The Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order.</span>
<a name="l5072"><span class="ln">5072 </span></a><span class="s0">Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.</span>
<a name="l5073"><span class="ln">5073 </span></a><span class="s0">The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one.</span>
<a name="l5074"><span class="ln">5074 </span></a><span class="s0">There were no windows in it at all.</span>
<a name="l5075"><span class="ln">5075 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston turned round abruptly.</span>
<a name="l5076"><span class="ln">5076 </span></a><span class="s0">He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen.</span>
<a name="l5077"><span class="ln">5077 </span></a><span class="s0">With the next he was more successful.</span>
<a name="l5078"><span class="ln">5078 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a peculiarly beautiful book.</span>
<a name="l5079"><span class="ln">5079 </span></a><span class="s0">He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase.</span>
<a name="l5080"><span class="ln">5080 </span></a><span class="s0">A tremor had gone through his bowels.</span>
<a name="l5081"><span class="ln">5081 </span></a><span class="s0">To mark the paper was the decisive act.</span>
<a name="l5082"><span class="ln">5082 </span></a><span class="s0">In small clumsy letters he wrote: April 4th, 1984.</span>
<a name="l5083"><span class="ln">5083 </span></a><span class="s0">He sat back.</span>
<a name="l5084"><span class="ln">5084 </span></a><span class="s0">A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him.</span>
<a name="l5085"><span class="ln">5085 </span></a><span class="s0">For the future, for the unborn.</span>
<a name="l5086"><span class="ln">5086 </span></a><span class="s0">How could you communicate with the future?</span>
<a name="l5087"><span class="ln">5087 </span></a><span class="s0">It was of its nature impossible.</span>
<a name="l5088"><span class="ln">5088 </span></a><span class="s0">For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper.</span>
<a name="l5089"><span class="ln">5089 </span></a><span class="s0">The telescreen had changed over to strident military music.</span>
<a name="l5090"><span class="ln">5090 </span></a><span class="s0">The actual writing would be easy.</span>
<a name="l5091"><span class="ln">5091 </span></a><span class="s0">At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up.</span>
<a name="l5092"><span class="ln">5092 </span></a><span class="s0">Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably.</span>
<a name="l5093"><span class="ln">5093 </span></a><span class="s0">The seconds were ticking by.</span>
<a name="l5094"><span class="ln">5094 </span></a><span class="s0">Last night to the flicks.</span>
<a name="l5095"><span class="ln">5095 </span></a><span class="s0">All war films.</span>
<a name="l5096"><span class="ln">5096 </span></a><span class="s0">He knew the reason.</span>
<a name="l5097"><span class="ln">5097 </span></a><span class="s0">That, it was true, was very unlikely.</span>
<a name="l5098"><span class="ln">5098 </span></a><span class="s0">Something in his face suggested it irresistibly.</span>
<a name="l5099"><span class="ln">5099 </span></a><span class="s0">The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.</span>
<a name="l5100"><span class="ln">5100 </span></a><span class="s0">The Hate had started.</span>
<a name="l5101"><span class="ln">5101 </span></a><span class="s0">There were hisses here and there among the audience.</span>
<a name="l5102"><span class="ln">5102 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston's diaphragm was constricted.</span>
<a name="l5103"><span class="ln">5103 </span></a><span class="s0">The Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be.</span>
<a name="l5104"><span class="ln">5104 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a book without a title.</span>
<a name="l5105"><span class="ln">5105 </span></a><span class="s0">But one knew of such things only through vague rumours.</span>
<a name="l5106"><span class="ln">5106 </span></a><span class="s0">In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy.</span>
<a name="l5107"><span class="ln">5107 </span></a><span class="s0">Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed.</span>
<a name="l5108"><span class="ln">5108 </span></a><span class="s0">The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out 'Swine!</span>
<a name="l5109"><span class="ln">5109 </span></a><span class="s0">Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary.</span>
<a name="l5110"><span class="ln">5110 </span></a><span class="s0">Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.</span>
<a name="l5111"><span class="ln">5111 </span></a><span class="s0">He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon.</span>
<a name="l5112"><span class="ln">5112 </span></a><span class="s0">The Hate rose to its climax.</span>
<a name="l5113"><span class="ln">5113 </span></a><span class="s0">Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying.</span>
<a name="l5114"><span class="ln">5114 </span></a><span class="s0">Then she buried her face in her hands.</span>
<a name="l5115"><span class="ln">5115 </span></a><span class="s0">It was apparent that she was uttering a prayer.</span>
<a name="l5116"><span class="ln">5116 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold.</span>
<a name="l5117"><span class="ln">5117 </span></a><span class="s0">Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye.</span>
<a name="l5118"><span class="ln">5118 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien had stood up.</span>
<a name="l5119"><span class="ln">5119 </span></a><span class="s0">An unmistakable message had passed.</span>
<a name="l5120"><span class="ln">5120 </span></a><span class="s0">'I know precisely what you are feeling.</span>
<a name="l5121"><span class="ln">5121 </span></a><span class="s0">I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust.</span>
<a name="l5122"><span class="ln">5122 </span></a><span class="s0">Such incidents never had any sequel.</span>
<a name="l5123"><span class="ln">5123 </span></a><span class="s0">Some days he believed in it, some days not.</span>
<a name="l5124"><span class="ln">5124 </span></a><span class="s0">It was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything.</span>
<a name="l5125"><span class="ln">5125 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston roused himself and sat up straighter.</span>
<a name="l5126"><span class="ln">5126 </span></a><span class="s0">He let out a belch.</span>
<a name="l5127"><span class="ln">5127 </span></a><span class="s0">The gin was rising from his stomach.</span>
<a name="l5128"><span class="ln">5128 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyes re-focused on the page.</span>
<a name="l5129"><span class="ln">5129 </span></a><span class="s0">He could not help feeling a twinge of panic.</span>
<a name="l5130"><span class="ln">5130 </span></a><span class="s0">The Thought Police would get him just the same.</span>
<a name="l5131"><span class="ln">5131 </span></a><span class="s0">Thoughtcrime, they called it.</span>
<a name="l5132"><span class="ln">5132 </span></a><span class="s0">It was always at night—the arrests invariably happened at night.</span>
<a name="l5133"><span class="ln">5133 </span></a><span class="s0">People simply disappeared, always during the night.</span>
<a name="l5134"><span class="ln">5134 </span></a><span class="s0">You were abolished, annihilated: VAPORIZED was the usual word.</span>
<a name="l5135"><span class="ln">5135 </span></a><span class="s0">The next moment he started violently.</span>
<a name="l5136"><span class="ln">5136 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a knocking at the door.</span>
<a name="l5137"><span class="ln">5137 </span></a><span class="s0">But no, the knocking was repeated.</span>
<a name="l5138"><span class="ln">5138 </span></a><span class="s0">The worst thing of all would be to delay.</span>
<a name="l5139"><span class="ln">5139 </span></a><span class="s0">He got up and moved heavily towards the door.</span>
<a name="l5140"><span class="ln">5140 </span></a><span class="s0">It was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done.</span>
<a name="l5141"><span class="ln">5141 </span></a><span class="s0">He drew in his breath and opened the door.</span>
<a name="l5142"><span class="ln">5142 </span></a><span class="s0">Instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through him.</span>
<a name="l5143"><span class="ln">5143 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston followed her down the passage.</span>
<a name="l5144"><span class="ln">5144 </span></a><span class="s0">These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation.</span>
<a name="l5145"><span class="ln">5145 </span></a><span class="s0">'They haven't been out today.</span>
<a name="l5146"><span class="ln">5146 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint of the pipe.</span>
<a name="l5147"><span class="ln">5147 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs Parsons looked on helplessly.</span>
<a name="l5148"><span class="ln">5148 </span></a><span class="s0">'He loves anything like that.</span>
<a name="l5149"><span class="ln">5149 </span></a><span class="s0">'A spanner,' said Mrs Parsons, immediately becoming invertebrate.</span>
<a name="l5150"><span class="ln">5150 </span></a><span class="s0">'I don't know, I'm sure.</span>
<a name="l5151"><span class="ln">5151 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs Parsons brought the spanner.</span>
<a name="l5152"><span class="ln">5152 </span></a><span class="s0">'Up with your hands!' yelled a savage voice.</span>
<a name="l5153"><span class="ln">5153 </span></a><span class="s0">'You're a traitor!' yelled the boy.</span>
<a name="l5154"><span class="ln">5154 </span></a><span class="s0">'You're a thought-criminal!</span>
<a name="l5155"><span class="ln">5155 </span></a><span class="s0">You're a Eurasian spy!</span>
<a name="l5156"><span class="ln">5156 </span></a><span class="s0">'They do get so noisy,' she said.</span>
<a name="l5157"><span class="ln">5157 </span></a><span class="s0">I'm too busy to take them.</span>
<a name="l5158"><span class="ln">5158 </span></a><span class="s0">'Want to see the hanging!</span>
<a name="l5159"><span class="ln">5159 </span></a><span class="s0">Children always clamoured to be taken to see it.</span>
<a name="l5160"><span class="ln">5160 </span></a><span class="s0">The music from the telescreen had stopped.</span>
<a name="l5161"><span class="ln">5161 </span></a><span class="s0">Nearly all children nowadays were horrible.</span>
<a name="l5162"><span class="ln">5162 </span></a><span class="s0">The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off.</span>
<a name="l5163"><span class="ln">5163 </span></a><span class="s0">Suddenly he began thinking of O'Brien again.</span>
<a name="l5164"><span class="ln">5164 </span></a><span class="s0">Years ago—how long was it?</span>
<a name="l5165"><span class="ln">5165 </span></a><span class="s0">He had walked on without pausing.</span>
<a name="l5166"><span class="ln">5166 </span></a><span class="s0">But at any rate the identification existed.</span>
<a name="l5167"><span class="ln">5167 </span></a><span class="s0">Nor did it even seem to matter greatly.</span>
<a name="l5168"><span class="ln">5168 </span></a><span class="s0">The voice continued raspingly: 'Attention!</span>
<a name="l5169"><span class="ln">5169 </span></a><span class="s0">Your attention, please!</span>
<a name="l5170"><span class="ln">5170 </span></a><span class="s0">A newsflash has this moment arrived from the Malabar front.</span>
<a name="l5171"><span class="ln">5171 </span></a><span class="s0">Our forces in South India have won a glorious victory.</span>
<a name="l5172"><span class="ln">5172 </span></a><span class="s0">Here is the newsflash— —' Bad news coming, thought Winston.</span>
<a name="l5173"><span class="ln">5173 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston belched again.</span>
<a name="l5174"><span class="ln">5174 </span></a><span class="s0">The gin was wearing off, leaving a deflated feeling.</span>
<a name="l5175"><span class="ln">5175 </span></a><span class="s0">You were supposed to stand to attention.</span>
<a name="l5176"><span class="ln">5176 </span></a><span class="s0">However, in his present position he was invisible.</span>
<a name="l5177"><span class="ln">5177 </span></a><span class="s0">'Oceania, 'tis for thee' gave way to lighter music.</span>
<a name="l5178"><span class="ln">5178 </span></a><span class="s0">The day was still cold and clear.</span>

<a name="l5181"><span class="ln">5181 </span></a><span class="s0">He was alone.</span>
<a name="l5182"><span class="ln">5182 </span></a><span class="s0">The past was dead, the future was unimaginable.</span>
<a name="l5183"><span class="ln">5183 </span></a><span class="s0">Even from the coin the eyes pursued you.</span>
<a name="l5184"><span class="ln">5184 </span></a><span class="s0">Always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you.</span>
<a name="l5185"><span class="ln">5185 </span></a><span class="s0">His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape.</span>
<a name="l5186"><span class="ln">5186 </span></a><span class="s0">It was too strong, it could not be stormed.</span>
<a name="l5187"><span class="ln">5187 </span></a><span class="s0">A thousand rocket bombs would not batter it down.</span>
<a name="l5188"><span class="ln">5188 </span></a><span class="s0">He wondered again for whom he was writing the diary.</span>
<a name="l5189"><span class="ln">5189 </span></a><span class="s0">The telescreen struck fourteen.</span>
<a name="l5190"><span class="ln">5190 </span></a><span class="s0">He must leave in ten minutes.</span>
<a name="l5191"><span class="ln">5191 </span></a><span class="s0">He had to be back at work by fourteen-thirty.</span>
<a name="l5192"><span class="ln">5192 </span></a><span class="s0">36 1984 He was already dead, he reflected.</span>
<a name="l5193"><span class="ln">5193 </span></a><span class="s0">He wrote: Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.</span>
<a name="l5194"><span class="ln">5194 </span></a><span class="s0">Two fingers of his right hand were inkstained.</span>
<a name="l5195"><span class="ln">5195 </span></a><span class="s0">He put the diary away in the drawer.</span>
<a name="l5196"><span class="ln">5196 </span></a><span class="s0">A hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious.</span>
<a name="l5197"><span class="ln">5197 </span></a><span class="s0">Both of them were looking up at him.</span>
<a name="l5198"><span class="ln">5198 </span></a><span class="s0">Such things, he saw, could not happen today.</span>
<a name="l5199"><span class="ln">5199 </span></a><span class="s0">In his waking thoughts he called it the Golden Country.</span>
<a name="l5200"><span class="ln">5200 </span></a><span class="s0">That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time.</span>
<a name="l5201"><span class="ln">5201 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston woke up with the word 'Shakespeare' on his lips.</span>
<a name="l5202"><span class="ln">5202 </span></a><span class="s0">The Physical Jerks would begin in three minutes.</span>

<a name="l5216"><span class="ln">5216 </span></a><span class="s0">I said so, Ma, didn't I?</span>

<a name="l5276"><span class="ln">5276 </span></a><span class="s0">'Not one!' said Winston with a sort of guilty haste.</span>
<a name="l5277"><span class="ln">5277 </span></a><span class="s0">There had been a famine of them for months past.</span>

<a name="l5294"><span class="ln">5294 </span></a><span class="s0">A word contains its opposite in itself.</span>
<a name="l5295"><span class="ln">5295 </span></a><span class="s0">Take 'good', for instance.</span>
<a name="l5296"><span class="ln">5296 </span></a><span class="s0">Of course we use those forms already.</span>
<a name="l5297"><span class="ln">5297 </span></a><span class="s0">Don't you see the beauty of that, Winston?</span>
<a name="l5298"><span class="ln">5298 </span></a><span class="s0">Nevertheless Syme immediately detected a certain lack of enthusiasm.</span>
<a name="l5299"><span class="ln">5299 </span></a><span class="s0">'Even when you write it you're still thinking in Oldspeak.</span>
<a name="l5300"><span class="ln">5300 </span></a><span class="s0">They're good enough, but they're translations.</span>

<a name="l5318"><span class="ln">5318 </span></a><span class="s0">For the rest it was just a noise, a quack-quack-quacking.</span>
<a name="l5319"><span class="ln">5319 </span></a><span class="s0">There was something subtly wrong with Syme.</span>
<a name="l5320"><span class="ln">5320 </span></a><span class="s0">You could not say that he was unorthodox.</span>
<a name="l5321"><span class="ln">5321 </span></a><span class="s0">Yet a faint air of disreputability always clung to him.</span>
<a name="l5322"><span class="ln">5322 </span></a><span class="s0">Syme's fate was not difficult to foresee.</span>
<a name="l5323"><span class="ln">5323 </span></a><span class="s0">Zeal was not enough.</span>
<a name="l5324"><span class="ln">5324 </span></a><span class="s0">Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.</span>
<a name="l5325"><span class="ln">5325 </span></a><span class="s0">Syme looked up.</span>

<a name="l5338"><span class="ln">5338 </span></a><span class="s0">So the chances were he was a foreigner.</span>

<a name="l5345"><span class="ln">5345 </span></a><span class="s0">Yes, they swallowed it.</span>
<a name="l5346"><span class="ln">5346 </span></a><span class="s0">Parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal.</span>
<a name="l5347"><span class="ln">5347 </span></a><span class="s0">Was he, then, ALONE in the possession of a memory?</span>
<a name="l5348"><span class="ln">5348 </span></a><span class="s0">The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen.</span>
<a name="l5349"><span class="ln">5349 </span></a><span class="s0">He meditated resentfully on the physical texture of life.</span>
<a name="l5350"><span class="ln">5350 </span></a><span class="s0">Had it always been like this?</span>
<a name="l5351"><span class="ln">5351 </span></a><span class="s0">Had food always tasted like this?</span>
<a name="l5352"><span class="ln">5352 </span></a><span class="s0">He looked round the canteen.</span>
<a name="l5353"><span class="ln">5353 </span></a><span class="s0">He looked round the canteen again.</span>
<a name="l5354"><span class="ln">5354 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs Parsons would be vaporized.</span>
<a name="l5355"><span class="ln">5355 </span></a><span class="s0">Syme would be vaporized.</span>

<a name="l5357"><span class="ln">5357 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien would be vaporized.</span>
<a name="l5358"><span class="ln">5358 </span></a><span class="s0">Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized.</span>
<a name="l5359"><span class="ln">5359 </span></a><span class="s0">It was the girl with dark hair.</span>
<a name="l5360"><span class="ln">5360 </span></a><span class="s0">The instant she caught his eye she looked away again.</span>
<a name="l5361"><span class="ln">5361 </span></a><span class="s0">The sweat started out on Winston's backbone.</span>
<a name="l5362"><span class="ln">5362 </span></a><span class="s0">A horrible pang of terror went through him.</span>
<a name="l5363"><span class="ln">5363 </span></a><span class="s0">Why was she watching him?</span>
<a name="l5364"><span class="ln">5364 </span></a><span class="s0">Why did she keep following him about?</span>
<a name="l5365"><span class="ln">5365 </span></a><span class="s0">The smallest thing could give you away.</span>
<a name="l5366"><span class="ln">5366 </span></a><span class="s0">The girl had turned her back on him again.</span>
<a name="l5367"><span class="ln">5367 </span></a><span class="s0">Parsons had begun talking again.</span>
<a name="l5368"><span class="ln">5368 </span></a><span class="s0">Burned her quite badly, I believe.</span>

<a name="l5373"><span class="ln">5373 </span></a><span class="s0">It was the signal to return to work.</span>
<a name="l5374"><span class="ln">5374 </span></a><span class="s0">She had a young face, painted very thick.</span>
<a name="l5375"><span class="ln">5375 </span></a><span class="s0">Party women never paint their faces.</span>

<a name="l5382"><span class="ln">5382 </span></a><span class="s0">It was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter.</span>
<a name="l5383"><span class="ln">5383 </span></a><span class="s0">The unforgivable crime was promiscuity between Party members.</span>
<a name="l5384"><span class="ln">5384 </span></a><span class="s0">He thought again of Katharine.</span>
<a name="l5385"><span class="ln">5385 </span></a><span class="s0">It was curious how seldom he thought of her.</span>
<a name="l5386"><span class="ln">5386 </span></a><span class="s0">They had only been together for about fifteen months.</span>

<a name="l5388"><span class="ln">5388 </span></a><span class="s0">To embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image.</span>
<a name="l5389"><span class="ln">5389 </span></a><span class="s0">The rigidlty of her muscles managed to convey that impression.</span>
<a name="l5390"><span class="ln">5390 </span></a><span class="s0">It was extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible.</span>
<a name="l5391"><span class="ln">5391 </span></a><span class="s0">But curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this.</span>
<a name="l5392"><span class="ln">5392 </span></a><span class="s0">They must, she said, produce a child if they could.</span>
<a name="l5393"><span class="ln">5393 </span></a><span class="s0">She had two names for it.</span>
<a name="l5394"><span class="ln">5394 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston sighed inaudibly.</span>
<a name="l5395"><span class="ln">5395 </span></a><span class="s0">Why did it always have to be like this?</span>
<a name="l5396"><span class="ln">5396 </span></a><span class="s0">But a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event.</span>

<a name="l5399"><span class="ln">5399 </span></a><span class="s0">The sexual act, successfully performed, was rebellion.</span>

<a name="l5412"><span class="ln">5412 </span></a><span class="s0">The proles are breaking loose at last!</span>
<a name="l5413"><span class="ln">5413 </span></a><span class="s0">Now the supply had unexpectedly given out.</span>
<a name="l5414"><span class="ln">5414 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a fresh outburst of yells.</span>
<a name="l5415"><span class="ln">5415 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston watched them disgustedly.</span>
<a name="l5416"><span class="ln">5416 </span></a><span class="s0">In reality very little was known about the proles.</span>
<a name="l5417"><span class="ln">5417 </span></a><span class="s0">It was not necessary to know much.</span>
<a name="l5418"><span class="ln">5418 </span></a><span class="s0">To keep them in control was not difficult.</span>
<a name="l5419"><span class="ln">5419 </span></a><span class="s0">The larger evils invariably escaped their notice.</span>
<a name="l5420"><span class="ln">5420 </span></a><span class="s0">Even the civil police interfered with them very little.</span>
<a name="l5421"><span class="ln">5421 </span></a><span class="s0">Promiscuity went unpunished, divorce was permitted.</span>
<a name="l5422"><span class="ln">5422 </span></a><span class="s0">They were beneath suspicion.</span>
<a name="l5423"><span class="ln">5423 </span></a><span class="s0">It had begun itching again.</span>
<a name="l5424"><span class="ln">5424 </span></a><span class="s0">These rich men were called capitalists.</span>
<a name="l5425"><span class="ln">5425 </span></a><span class="s0">How could you tell how much of it was lies?</span>
<a name="l5426"><span class="ln">5426 </span></a><span class="s0">He reached down and scratched his ankle again.</span>
<a name="l5427"><span class="ln">5427 </span></a><span class="s0">It was like a single equation with two unknowns.</span>
<a name="l5428"><span class="ln">5428 </span></a><span class="s0">Everything faded into mist.</span>
<a name="l5429"><span class="ln">5429 </span></a><span class="s0">It was the lonely hour of fifteen.</span>
<a name="l5430"><span class="ln">5430 </span></a><span class="s0">The place was almost empty.</span>
<a name="l5431"><span class="ln">5431 </span></a><span class="s0">A tinny music was trickling from the telescreens.</span>
<a name="l5432"><span class="ln">5432 </span></a><span class="s0">Uncommanded, the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin.</span>
<a name="l5433"><span class="ln">5433 </span></a><span class="s0">There came into it—but it was something hard to describe.</span>
<a name="l5434"><span class="ln">5434 </span></a><span class="s0">A little later all three were re-arrested.</span>
<a name="l5435"><span class="ln">5435 </span></a><span class="s0">There was only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies.</span>
<a name="l5436"><span class="ln">5436 </span></a><span class="s0">Of course, this was not in itself a discovery.</span>
<a name="l5437"><span class="ln">5437 </span></a><span class="s0">He had gone straight on working.</span>
<a name="l5438"><span class="ln">5438 </span></a><span class="s0">Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes.</span>
<a name="l5439"><span class="ln">5439 </span></a><span class="s0">That was ten—eleven years ago.</span>
<a name="l5440"><span class="ln">5440 </span></a><span class="s0">Today, probably, he would have kept that photograph.</span>
<a name="l5441"><span class="ln">5441 </span></a><span class="s0">The past not only changed, but changed continuously.</span>
<a name="l5442"><span class="ln">5442 </span></a><span class="s0">Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one.</span>
<a name="l5443"><span class="ln">5443 </span></a><span class="s0">The hypnotic eyes gazed into his own.</span>
<a name="l5444"><span class="ln">5444 </span></a><span class="s0">The heresy of heresies was common sense.</span>
<a name="l5445"><span class="ln">5445 </span></a><span class="s0">Or that the force of gravity works?</span>
<a name="l5446"><span class="ln">5446 </span></a><span class="s0">Or that the past is unchangeable?</span>
<a name="l5447"><span class="ln">5447 </span></a><span class="s0">His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord.</span>
<a name="l5448"><span class="ln">5448 </span></a><span class="s0">It was their final, most essential command.</span>
<a name="l5449"><span class="ln">5449 </span></a><span class="s0">And yet he was in the right!</span>
<a name="l5450"><span class="ln">5450 </span></a><span class="s0">They were wrong and he was right.</span>
<a name="l5451"><span class="ln">5451 </span></a><span class="s0">Truisms are true, hold on to that!</span>
<a name="l5452"><span class="ln">5452 </span></a><span class="s0">The solid world exists, its laws do not change.</span>
<a name="l5453"><span class="ln">5453 </span></a><span class="s0">If that is granted, all else follows.</span>
<a name="l5454"><span class="ln">5454 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston paused involuntarily.</span>
<a name="l5455"><span class="ln">5455 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston caught scraps of conversation as he approached.</span>
<a name="l5456"><span class="ln">5456 </span></a><span class="s0">That's jest where it is.' The strident voices stopped abruptly.</span>
<a name="l5457"><span class="ln">5457 </span></a><span class="s0">'May I see your papers, comrade?</span>
<a name="l5458"><span class="ln">5458 </span></a><span class="s0">What are you doing here?</span>
<a name="l5459"><span class="ln">5459 </span></a><span class="s0">What time did you leave work?</span>
<a name="l5460"><span class="ln">5460 </span></a><span class="s0">Suddenly the whole street was in commotion.</span>
<a name="l5461"><span class="ln">5461 </span></a><span class="s0">There were yells of warning from all sides.</span>
<a name="l5462"><span class="ln">5462 </span></a><span class="s0">People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits.</span>
<a name="l5463"><span class="ln">5463 </span></a><span class="s0">'Steamer!' he yelled.</span>
<a name="l5464"><span class="ln">5464 </span></a><span class="s0">'Look out, guv'nor!</span>
<a name="l5465"><span class="ln">5465 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston promptly flung himself on his face.</span>
<a name="l5466"><span class="ln">5466 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston clasped his forearms above his head.</span>
<a name="l5467"><span class="ln">5467 </span></a><span class="s0">He walked on.</span>
<a name="l5468"><span class="ln">5468 </span></a><span class="s0">'Can't you bleeding well listen to what I say?</span>
<a name="l5469"><span class="ln">5469 </span></a><span class="s0">I takes 'em down reg'lar as the clock.</span>
<a name="l5470"><span class="ln">5470 </span></a><span class="s0">I could pretty near tell you the bleeding number.</span>
<a name="l5471"><span class="ln">5471 </span></a><span class="s0">Four oh seven, it ended in.</span>
<a name="l5472"><span class="ln">5472 </span></a><span class="s0">It were in February—second week in February.' 'February your grandmother!</span>
<a name="l5473"><span class="ln">5473 </span></a><span class="s0">I got it all down in black and white.</span>
<a name="l5474"><span class="ln">5474 </span></a><span class="s0">They were talking about the Lottery.</span>
<a name="l5475"><span class="ln">5475 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston looked back when he had gone thirty metres.</span>
<a name="l5476"><span class="ln">5476 </span></a><span class="s0">They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces.</span>
<a name="l5477"><span class="ln">5477 </span></a><span class="s0">But if there was hope, it lay in the proles.</span>
<a name="l5478"><span class="ln">5478 </span></a><span class="s0">You had to cling on to that.</span>
<a name="l5479"><span class="ln">5479 </span></a><span class="s0">The street into which he had turned ran downhill.</span>
<a name="l5480"><span class="ln">5480 </span></a><span class="s0">From somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices.</span>
<a name="l5481"><span class="ln">5481 </span></a><span class="s0">At this moment Winston remembered where he was.</span>
<a name="l5482"><span class="ln">5482 </span></a><span class="s0">What was it like in those days?</span>
<a name="l5483"><span class="ln">5483 </span></a><span class="s0">It was madness of course.</span>
<a name="l5484"><span class="ln">5484 </span></a><span class="s0">''Ark at 'im!</span>
<a name="l5485"><span class="ln">5485 </span></a><span class="s0">'Litre and half litre—that's all we serve.</span>
<a name="l5486"><span class="ln">5486 </span></a><span class="s0">The old man's whitestubbled face had flushed pink.</span>
<a name="l5487"><span class="ln">5487 </span></a><span class="s0">He turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston.</span>
<a name="l5488"><span class="ln">5488 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston caught him gently by the arm.</span>
<a name="l5489"><span class="ln">5489 </span></a><span class="s0">'May I offer you a drink?' he said.</span>
<a name="l5490"><span class="ln">5490 </span></a><span class="s0">'You're a gent,' said the other, straightening his shoulders again.</span>
<a name="l5491"><span class="ln">5491 </span></a><span class="s0">He appeared not to have noticed Winston's blue overalls.</span>
<a name="l5492"><span class="ln">5492 </span></a><span class="s0">'Pint!' he added aggressively to the barman.</span>
<a name="l5493"><span class="ln">5493 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston's presence was forgotten for a moment.</span>
<a name="l5494"><span class="ln">5494 </span></a><span class="s0">'A 'alf litre ain't enough.</span>
<a name="l5495"><span class="ln">5495 </span></a><span class="s0">It Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 113 don't satisfy.</span>
<a name="l5496"><span class="ln">5496 </span></a><span class="s0">And a 'ole litre's too much.</span>
<a name="l5497"><span class="ln">5497 </span></a><span class="s0">It starts my bladder running.</span>
<a name="l5498"><span class="ln">5498 </span></a><span class="s0">'The beer was better,' he said finally.</span>
<a name="l5499"><span class="ln">5499 </span></a><span class="s0">'It's all wars,' said the old man vaguely.</span>
<a name="l5500"><span class="ln">5500 </span></a><span class="s0">He took up his glass, and his shoulders straightened again.</span>
<a name="l5501"><span class="ln">5501 </span></a><span class="s0">'You are very much older than I am,' said Winston.</span>
<a name="l5502"><span class="ln">5502 </span></a><span class="s0">I should like your opinion on that.</span>
<a name="l5503"><span class="ln">5503 </span></a><span class="s0">Half of them hadn't even boots on their feet.</span>
<a name="l5504"><span class="ln">5504 </span></a><span class="s0">They owned everything that there was to own.</span>
<a name="l5505"><span class="ln">5505 </span></a><span class="s0">'Top 'ats!' he said.</span>
<a name="l5506"><span class="ln">5506 </span></a><span class="s0">'Funny you should mention 'em.</span>
<a name="l5507"><span class="ln">5507 </span></a><span class="s0">Gorn right out, they 'ave.</span>
<a name="l5508"><span class="ln">5508 </span></a><span class="s0">Everything existed for their benefit.</span>
<a name="l5509"><span class="ln">5509 </span></a><span class="s0">You—the ordinary people, the workers—were their slaves.</span>
<a name="l5510"><span class="ln">5510 </span></a><span class="s0">They could do what they liked with you.</span>
<a name="l5511"><span class="ln">5511 </span></a><span class="s0">They could ship you off to Canada like cattle.</span>
<a name="l5512"><span class="ln">5512 </span></a><span class="s0">They could sleep with your daughters if they chose.</span>
<a name="l5513"><span class="ln">5513 </span></a><span class="s0">'Lackeys!' he said.</span>
<a name="l5514"><span class="ln">5514 </span></a><span class="s0">That reg'lar takes me back, that does.</span>
<a name="l5515"><span class="ln">5515 </span></a><span class="s0">Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews, Indians—all sorts there was.</span>
<a name="l5516"><span class="ln">5516 </span></a><span class="s0">'E didn't 'alf give it 'em!</span>
<a name="l5517"><span class="ln">5517 </span></a><span class="s0">'Lackeys!' 'e says, 'lackeys of the bourgeoisie!</span>
<a name="l5518"><span class="ln">5518 </span></a><span class="s0">And 'yenas—'e definitely called 'em 'yenas.</span>
<a name="l5519"><span class="ln">5519 </span></a><span class="s0">'What I really wanted to know was this,' he said.</span>
<a name="l5520"><span class="ln">5520 </span></a><span class="s0">Are you treated more like a human being?</span>
<a name="l5521"><span class="ln">5521 </span></a><span class="s0">'The House of Lords, if you like.</span>
<a name="l5522"><span class="ln">5522 </span></a><span class="s0">'Yes,' he said.</span>
<a name="l5523"><span class="ln">5523 </span></a><span class="s0">'They liked you to touch your cap to 'em.</span>
<a name="l5524"><span class="ln">5524 </span></a><span class="s0">116 1984 It showed respect, like.</span>
<a name="l5525"><span class="ln">5525 </span></a><span class="s0">'I recollect it as if it was yesterday.</span>
<a name="l5526"><span class="ln">5526 </span></a><span class="s0">Quite a gent, 'e was—dress shirt, top 'at, black overcoat.</span>
<a name="l5527"><span class="ln">5527 </span></a><span class="s0">He made a last attempt.</span>
<a name="l5528"><span class="ln">5528 </span></a><span class="s0">'Perhaps I have not made myself clear,' he said.</span>
<a name="l5529"><span class="ln">5529 </span></a><span class="s0">'What I'm trying to say is this.</span>
<a name="l5530"><span class="ln">5530 </span></a><span class="s0">In 1925, for instance, you were already grown up.</span>
<a name="l5531"><span class="ln">5531 </span></a><span class="s0">He finished up his beer, more slowly than before.</span>
<a name="l5532"><span class="ln">5532 </span></a><span class="s0">'I know what you expect me to say,' he said.</span>
<a name="l5533"><span class="ln">5533 </span></a><span class="s0">You got your 'ealth and strength when you're young.</span>
<a name="l5534"><span class="ln">5534 </span></a><span class="s0">You ain't got the same worries.</span>
<a name="l5535"><span class="ln">5535 </span></a><span class="s0">No truck with women, and that's a great thing.</span>
<a name="l5536"><span class="ln">5536 </span></a><span class="s0">It was no use going on.</span>
<a name="l5537"><span class="ln">5537 </span></a><span class="s0">The extra half-litre was already working on him.</span>
<a name="l5538"><span class="ln">5538 </span></a><span class="s0">At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly.</span>
<a name="l5539"><span class="ln">5539 </span></a><span class="s0">He halted and looked up.</span>
<a name="l5540"><span class="ln">5540 </span></a><span class="s0">He seemed to know the place.</span>
<a name="l5541"><span class="ln">5541 </span></a><span class="s0">A twinge of fear went through him.</span>
<a name="l5542"><span class="ln">5542 </span></a><span class="s0">'I recognized you on the pavement,' he said immediately.</span>
<a name="l5543"><span class="ln">5543 </span></a><span class="s0">'You're the gentleman that bought the young lady's keepsake album.</span>
<a name="l5544"><span class="ln">5544 </span></a><span class="s0">That was a beautiful bit of paper, that was.</span>
<a name="l5545"><span class="ln">5545 </span></a><span class="s0">Creamlaid, it used to be called.</span>
<a name="l5546"><span class="ln">5546 </span></a><span class="s0">'Is there anything special I can do for you?</span>
<a name="l5547"><span class="ln">5547 </span></a><span class="s0">'I just looked in.</span>
<a name="l5548"><span class="ln">5548 </span></a><span class="s0">Between you and me, the antique trade's just about finished.</span>
<a name="l5549"><span class="ln">5549 </span></a><span class="s0">No demand any longer, and no stock either.</span>
<a name="l5550"><span class="ln">5550 </span></a><span class="s0">Furniture, china, glass it's all been broken up by degrees.</span>
<a name="l5551"><span class="ln">5551 </span></a><span class="s0">And of course the metal stuff's mostly been melted down.</span>
<a name="l5552"><span class="ln">5552 </span></a><span class="s0">'What is it?' said Winston, fascinated.</span>
<a name="l5553"><span class="ln">5553 </span></a><span class="s0">'That's coral, that is,' said the old man.</span>
<a name="l5554"><span class="ln">5554 </span></a><span class="s0">'It must have come from the Indian Ocean.</span>
<a name="l5555"><span class="ln">5555 </span></a><span class="s0">They used to kind of embed it in the glass.</span>
<a name="l5556"><span class="ln">5556 </span></a><span class="s0">That wasn't made less than a hundred years ago.</span>
<a name="l5557"><span class="ln">5557 </span></a><span class="s0">'It is a beautiful thing,' said the other appreciatively.</span>
<a name="l5558"><span class="ln">5558 </span></a><span class="s0">'But there's not many that'd say so nowadays.' He coughed.</span>
<a name="l5559"><span class="ln">5559 </span></a><span class="s0">'There's not much in it.</span>
<a name="l5560"><span class="ln">5560 </span></a><span class="s0">Just a few pieces.</span>
<a name="l5561"><span class="ln">5561 </span></a><span class="s0">'I'm selling the furniture off by little and little.</span>
<a name="l5562"><span class="ln">5562 </span></a><span class="s0">'There's no telescreen!' he could not help murmuring.</span>
<a name="l5563"><span class="ln">5563 </span></a><span class="s0">Now that's a nice gateleg table in the corner there.</span>
<a name="l5564"><span class="ln">5564 </span></a><span class="s0">It contained nothing but rubbish.</span>
<a name="l5565"><span class="ln">5565 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston came across to examine the picture.</span>
<a name="l5566"><span class="ln">5566 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston gazed at it for some moments.</span>
<a name="l5567"><span class="ln">5567 </span></a><span class="s0">'It's a ruin now.</span>
<a name="l5568"><span class="ln">5568 </span></a><span class="s0">Outside the Law Courts.</span>
<a name="l5569"><span class="ln">5569 </span></a><span class="s0">It was bombed in— oh, many years ago.</span>
<a name="l5570"><span class="ln">5570 </span></a><span class="s0">It was just names of churches.</span>
<a name="l5571"><span class="ln">5571 </span></a><span class="s0">'I never knew it had been a church,' he said.</span>
<a name="l5572"><span class="ln">5572 </span></a><span class="s0">Now, how did that rhyme go?</span>
<a name="l5573"><span class="ln">5573 </span></a><span class="s0">I've got it!</span>
<a name="l5574"><span class="ln">5574 </span></a><span class="s0">That's still standing.</span>
<a name="l5575"><span class="ln">5575 </span></a><span class="s0">It's in Victory Square, alongside the picture gallery.</span>
<a name="l5576"><span class="ln">5576 </span></a><span class="s0">Yes, he thought again, he would come back.</span>
<a name="l5577"><span class="ln">5577 </span></a><span class="s0">He would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish.</span>
<a name="l5578"><span class="ln">5578 </span></a><span class="s0">For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move.</span>
<a name="l5579"><span class="ln">5579 </span></a><span class="s0">At any rate, one question was settled.</span>
<a name="l5580"><span class="ln">5580 </span></a><span class="s0">It was too great a coincidence.</span>
<a name="l5581"><span class="ln">5581 </span></a><span class="s0">It was enough that she was watching him.</span>
<a name="l5582"><span class="ln">5582 </span></a><span class="s0">It was an effort to walk.</span>
<a name="l5583"><span class="ln">5583 </span></a><span class="s0">The worst thing was the pain in his belly.</span>
<a name="l5584"><span class="ln">5584 </span></a><span class="s0">Then the spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.</span>
<a name="l5585"><span class="ln">5585 </span></a><span class="s0">The street was a blind alley.</span>
<a name="l5586"><span class="ln">5586 </span></a><span class="s0">He could not run, he could not strike a blow.</span>
<a name="l5587"><span class="ln">5587 </span></a><span class="s0">Besides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself.</span>
<a name="l5588"><span class="ln">5588 </span></a><span class="s0">But that too was impossible.</span>
<a name="l5589"><span class="ln">5589 </span></a><span class="s0">A deadly lassitude had taken hold of him.</span>
<a name="l5590"><span class="ln">5590 </span></a><span class="s0">But he did not open it at once.</span>
<a name="l5591"><span class="ln">5591 </span></a><span class="s0">Undoubtedly some people did so.</span>
<a name="l5592"><span class="ln">5592 </span></a><span class="s0">Many of the disappearances were actually suicides.</span>
<a name="l5593"><span class="ln">5593 </span></a><span class="s0">He opened the diary.</span>
<a name="l5594"><span class="ln">5594 </span></a><span class="s0">It was important to write something down.</span>
<a name="l5595"><span class="ln">5595 </span></a><span class="s0">The woman on the telescreen had started a new song.</span>
<a name="l5596"><span class="ln">5596 </span></a><span class="s0">It would not matter if they killed you at once.</span>
<a name="l5597"><span class="ln">5597 </span></a><span class="s0">To be killed was what you expected.</span>
<a name="l5598"><span class="ln">5598 </span></a><span class="s0">Nobody ever escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess.</span>
<a name="l5599"><span class="ln">5599 </span></a><span class="s0">He knew what it meant, or thought he knew.</span>
<a name="l5600"><span class="ln">5600 </span></a><span class="s0">He put a cigarette in his mouth.</span>
<a name="l5601"><span class="ln">5601 </span></a><span class="s0">It was the girl with dark hair.</span>
<a name="l5602"><span class="ln">5602 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a common accident in the Fiction Department.</span>
<a name="l5603"><span class="ln">5603 </span></a><span class="s0">A sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her.</span>
<a name="l5604"><span class="ln">5604 </span></a><span class="s0">She must have fallen right on the injured arm.</span>
<a name="l5605"><span class="ln">5605 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston stopped short.</span>
<a name="l5606"><span class="ln">5606 </span></a><span class="s0">The girl had risen to her knees.</span>
<a name="l5607"><span class="ln">5607 </span></a><span class="s0">A curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart.</span>
<a name="l5608"><span class="ln">5608 </span></a><span class="s0">'You're hurt?' he said.</span>
<a name="l5609"><span class="ln">5609 </span></a><span class="s0">She had certainly turned very pale.</span>
<a name="l5610"><span class="ln">5610 </span></a><span class="s0">'You haven't broken anything?' 'No, I'm all right.</span>
<a name="l5611"><span class="ln">5611 </span></a><span class="s0">'It's nothing,' she repeated shortly.</span>
<a name="l5612"><span class="ln">5612 </span></a><span class="s0">'I only gave my wrist a bit of a bang.</span>
<a name="l5613"><span class="ln">5613 </span></a><span class="s0">There was no question that she had done it intentionally.</span>
<a name="l5614"><span class="ln">5614 </span></a><span class="s0">It was something small and flat.</span>
<a name="l5615"><span class="ln">5615 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a scrap of paper folded into a square.</span>
<a name="l5616"><span class="ln">5616 </span></a><span class="s0">But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew.</span>
<a name="l5617"><span class="ln">5617 </span></a><span class="s0">So far as he could see there were two possibilities.</span>
<a name="l5618"><span class="ln">5618 </span></a><span class="s0">Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all!</span>
<a name="l5619"><span class="ln">5619 </span></a><span class="s0">Perhaps the girl was part of it!</span>
<a name="l5620"><span class="ln">5620 </span></a><span class="s0">Eight minutes had gone by.</span>
<a name="l5621"><span class="ln">5621 </span></a><span class="s0">He flattened it out.</span>
<a name="l5622"><span class="ln">5622 </span></a><span class="s0">Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled canteen was torment.</span>
<a name="l5623"><span class="ln">5623 </span></a><span class="s0">The afternoon was more bearable.</span>
<a name="l5624"><span class="ln">5624 </span></a><span class="s0">Tonight was one of his nights at the Community Centre.</span>
<a name="l5625"><span class="ln">5625 </span></a><span class="s0">But the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous.</span>
<a name="l5626"><span class="ln">5626 </span></a><span class="s0">Whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced you.</span>
<a name="l5627"><span class="ln">5627 </span></a><span class="s0">Actually, few people ever wrote letters.</span>
<a name="l5628"><span class="ln">5628 </span></a><span class="s0">Finally he decided that the safest place was the canteen.</span>
<a name="l5629"><span class="ln">5629 </span></a><span class="s0">They passed each other without a glance.</span>
<a name="l5630"><span class="ln">5630 </span></a><span class="s0">He did not touch the diary during those days.</span>
<a name="l5631"><span class="ln">5631 </span></a><span class="s0">There was no enquiry he could make.</span>
<a name="l5632"><span class="ln">5632 </span></a><span class="s0">The next day she reappeared.</span>
<a name="l5633"><span class="ln">5633 </span></a><span class="s0">It was early, and the place was not very full.</span>
<a name="l5634"><span class="ln">5634 </span></a><span class="s0">She was perhaps three metres away from him.</span>
<a name="l5635"><span class="ln">5635 </span></a><span class="s0">Another two seconds would do it.</span>
<a name="l5636"><span class="ln">5636 </span></a><span class="s0">'Smith!' repeated the voice, more loudly.</span>
<a name="l5637"><span class="ln">5637 </span></a><span class="s0">It was no use.</span>
<a name="l5638"><span class="ln">5638 </span></a><span class="s0">He turned round.</span>
<a name="l5639"><span class="ln">5639 </span></a><span class="s0">It was not safe to refuse.</span>
<a name="l5640"><span class="ln">5640 </span></a><span class="s0">It was too noticeable.</span>
<a name="l5641"><span class="ln">5641 </span></a><span class="s0">He sat down with a friendly smile.</span>
<a name="l5642"><span class="ln">5642 </span></a><span class="s0">The silly blond face beamed into his.</span>
<a name="l5643"><span class="ln">5643 </span></a><span class="s0">The girl's table filled up a few minutes later.</span>
<a name="l5644"><span class="ln">5644 </span></a><span class="s0">Next day he took care to arrive early.</span>
<a name="l5645"><span class="ln">5645 </span></a><span class="s0">His hopes sank again.</span>
<a name="l5646"><span class="ln">5646 </span></a><span class="s0">With ice at his heart Winston followed.</span>
<a name="l5647"><span class="ln">5647 </span></a><span class="s0">At this moment there was a tremendous crash.</span>
<a name="l5648"><span class="ln">5648 </span></a><span class="s0">But it was all right.</span>
<a name="l5649"><span class="ln">5649 </span></a><span class="s0">He did not look at her.</span>
<a name="l5650"><span class="ln">5650 </span></a><span class="s0">He unpacked his tray and promptly began eating.</span>
<a name="l5651"><span class="ln">5651 </span></a><span class="s0">There was perhaps a minute in which to act.</span>
<a name="l5652"><span class="ln">5652 </span></a><span class="s0">Both Winston and the girl were eating steadily.</span>
<a name="l5653"><span class="ln">5653 </span></a><span class="s0">In a low murmur Winston began speaking.</span>
<a name="l5654"><span class="ln">5654 </span></a><span class="s0">And don't look at me.</span>
<a name="l5655"><span class="ln">5655 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time.</span>
<a name="l5656"><span class="ln">5656 </span></a><span class="s0">Again the terrible fear seized upon Winston.</span>
<a name="l5657"><span class="ln">5657 </span></a><span class="s0">She was not coming, she had changed her mind!</span>
<a name="l5658"><span class="ln">5658 </span></a><span class="s0">There were telescreens all round the pediment.</span>
<a name="l5659"><span class="ln">5659 </span></a><span class="s0">Suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square.</span>
<a name="l5660"><span class="ln">5660 </span></a><span class="s0">He was next to the girl.</span>
<a name="l5661"><span class="ln">5661 </span></a><span class="s0">Truck-load after truck-load of the sad faces passed.</span>
<a name="l5662"><span class="ln">5662 </span></a><span class="s0">You'll have to remember this.</span>
<a name="l5663"><span class="ln">5663 </span></a><span class="s0">'Can you remember all that?' she murmured finally.</span>
<a name="l5664"><span class="ln">5664 </span></a><span class="s0">And the gate's got no top bar.' 'Yes.</span>
<a name="l5665"><span class="ln">5665 </span></a><span class="s0">What time?' 'About fifteen.</span>
<a name="l5666"><span class="ln">5666 </span></a><span class="s0">You may have to wait.</span>
<a name="l5667"><span class="ln">5667 </span></a><span class="s0">I'll get there by another way.</span>
<a name="l5668"><span class="ln">5668 </span></a><span class="s0">The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity.</span>
<a name="l5669"><span class="ln">5669 </span></a><span class="s0">The convoy was drawing to an end.</span>
<a name="l5670"><span class="ln">5670 </span></a><span class="s0">He had time to learn every detail of her hand.</span>
<a name="l5671"><span class="ln">5671 </span></a><span class="s0">The air seemed to kiss one's skin.</span>
<a name="l5672"><span class="ln">5672 </span></a><span class="s0">It was the second of May.</span>
<a name="l5673"><span class="ln">5673 </span></a><span class="s0">He was a bit early.</span>
<a name="l5674"><span class="ln">5674 </span></a><span class="s0">Presumably she could be trusted to find a safe place.</span>
<a name="l5675"><span class="ln">5675 </span></a><span class="s0">He went on picking bluebells.</span>
<a name="l5676"><span class="ln">5676 </span></a><span class="s0">It was the best thing to do.</span>
<a name="l5677"><span class="ln">5677 </span></a><span class="s0">To look round was to show guilt.</span>
<a name="l5678"><span class="ln">5678 </span></a><span class="s0">He picked another and another.</span>
<a name="l5679"><span class="ln">5679 </span></a><span class="s0">A hand fell lightly on his shoulder.</span>
<a name="l5680"><span class="ln">5680 </span></a><span class="s0">He looked up.</span>
<a name="l5681"><span class="ln">5681 </span></a><span class="s0">It was the girl.</span>
<a name="l5682"><span class="ln">5682 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston followed, still clasping his bunch of flowers.</span>
<a name="l5683"><span class="ln">5683 </span></a><span class="s0">The girl stopped and turned.</span>
<a name="l5684"><span class="ln">5684 </span></a><span class="s0">'Here we are,' she said.</span>
<a name="l5685"><span class="ln">5685 </span></a><span class="s0">He was facing her at several paces' distance.</span>
<a name="l5686"><span class="ln">5686 </span></a><span class="s0">As yet he did not dare move nearer to her.</span>
<a name="l5687"><span class="ln">5687 </span></a><span class="s0">I don't suppose there is, but there could be.</span>
<a name="l5688"><span class="ln">5688 </span></a><span class="s0">'We're all right here?' he repeated stupidly.</span>
<a name="l5689"><span class="ln">5689 </span></a><span class="s0">'There's nothing big enough to hide a mike in.</span>
<a name="l5690"><span class="ln">5690 </span></a><span class="s0">Besides, I've been here before.' They were only making conversation.</span>
<a name="l5691"><span class="ln">5691 </span></a><span class="s0">The bluebells had cascaded on to the ground.</span>
<a name="l5692"><span class="ln">5692 </span></a><span class="s0">They seemed to have fallen of their own accord.</span>
<a name="l5693"><span class="ln">5693 </span></a><span class="s0">He took her hand.</span>
<a name="l5694"><span class="ln">5694 </span></a><span class="s0">I've got a wife that I can't get rid of.</span>
<a name="l5695"><span class="ln">5695 </span></a><span class="s0">I've got varicose veins.</span>
<a name="l5696"><span class="ln">5696 </span></a><span class="s0">At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity.</span>
<a name="l5697"><span class="ln">5697 </span></a><span class="s0">All he felt was incredulity and pride.</span>
<a name="l5698"><span class="ln">5698 </span></a><span class="s0">She sat against him, putting her arm round his waist.</span>
<a name="l5699"><span class="ln">5699 </span></a><span class="s0">'Never mind, dear.</span>
<a name="l5700"><span class="ln">5700 </span></a><span class="s0">There's no hurry.</span>
<a name="l5701"><span class="ln">5701 </span></a><span class="s0">We've got the whole afternoon.</span>
<a name="l5702"><span class="ln">5702 </span></a><span class="s0">Isn't this a splendid hide-out?</span>
<a name="l5703"><span class="ln">5703 </span></a><span class="s0">I know yours.</span>
<a name="l5704"><span class="ln">5704 </span></a><span class="s0">'I hated the sight of you,' he said.</span>
<a name="l5705"><span class="ln">5705 </span></a><span class="s0">'I wanted to rape you and then murder you afterwards.</span>
<a name="l5706"><span class="ln">5706 </span></a><span class="s0">'Not the Thought Police!</span>
<a name="l5707"><span class="ln">5707 </span></a><span class="s0">You didn't honestly think that?' 'Well, perhaps not exactly that.</span>
<a name="l5708"><span class="ln">5708 </span></a><span class="s0">Pure in word and deed.</span>
<a name="l5709"><span class="ln">5709 </span></a><span class="s0">Banners, processions, slogans, games, community hikes all that stuff.</span>
<a name="l5710"><span class="ln">5710 </span></a><span class="s0">'Where did you get this stuff?' he said.</span>
<a name="l5711"><span class="ln">5711 </span></a><span class="s0">'Black market,' she said indifferently.</span>
<a name="l5712"><span class="ln">5712 </span></a><span class="s0">'Actually I am that sort of girl, to look at.</span>
<a name="l5713"><span class="ln">5713 </span></a><span class="s0">I'm good at games.</span>
<a name="l5714"><span class="ln">5714 </span></a><span class="s0">I was a troop-leader in the Spies.</span>
<a name="l5715"><span class="ln">5715 </span></a><span class="s0">I always Iook cheerful and I never shirk anything.</span>
<a name="l5716"><span class="ln">5716 </span></a><span class="s0">Always yell with the crowd, that's what I say.</span>
<a name="l5717"><span class="ln">5717 </span></a><span class="s0">The taste was delightful.</span>
<a name="l5718"><span class="ln">5718 </span></a><span class="s0">'You are very young,' he said.</span>
<a name="l5719"><span class="ln">5719 </span></a><span class="s0">'You are ten or fifteen years younger than I am.</span>
<a name="l5720"><span class="ln">5720 </span></a><span class="s0">I thought I'd take a chance.</span>
<a name="l5721"><span class="ln">5721 </span></a><span class="s0">I'm good at spotting people who don't belong.</span>
<a name="l5722"><span class="ln">5722 </span></a><span class="s0">He did not dislike it.</span>
<a name="l5723"><span class="ln">5723 </span></a><span class="s0">They did not speak above a whisper.</span>
<a name="l5724"><span class="ln">5724 </span></a><span class="s0">Presently they had reached the edge of the little wood.</span>
<a name="l5725"><span class="ln">5725 </span></a><span class="s0">She stopped him.</span>
<a name="l5726"><span class="ln">5726 </span></a><span class="s0">'Don't go out into the open.</span>
<a name="l5727"><span class="ln">5727 </span></a><span class="s0">There might be someone watching.</span>
<a name="l5728"><span class="ln">5728 </span></a><span class="s0">He knew it by sight.</span>
<a name="l5729"><span class="ln">5729 </span></a><span class="s0">'Isn't there a stream somewhere near here?' he whispered.</span>
<a name="l5730"><span class="ln">5730 </span></a><span class="s0">'That's right, there is a stream.</span>
<a name="l5731"><span class="ln">5731 </span></a><span class="s0">It's at the edge of the next field, actually.</span>
<a name="l5732"><span class="ln">5732 </span></a><span class="s0">There are fish in it, great big ones.</span>
<a name="l5733"><span class="ln">5733 </span></a><span class="s0">'The Golden Country?' 'It's nothing, really.</span>
<a name="l5734"><span class="ln">5734 </span></a><span class="s0">Perhaps it had not seen them.</span>
<a name="l5735"><span class="ln">5735 </span></a><span class="s0">It was in the sun, they in the shade.</span>
<a name="l5736"><span class="ln">5736 </span></a><span class="s0">In the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling.</span>
<a name="l5737"><span class="ln">5737 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston and Julia clung together, fascinated.</span>
<a name="l5738"><span class="ln">5738 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence.</span>
<a name="l5739"><span class="ln">5739 </span></a><span class="s0">For whom, for what, was that bird singing?</span>
<a name="l5740"><span class="ln">5740 </span></a><span class="s0">No mate, no rival was watching it.</span>
<a name="l5741"><span class="ln">5741 </span></a><span class="s0">He stopped thinking and merely felt.</span>
<a name="l5742"><span class="ln">5742 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston put his lips against her ear.</span>
<a name="l5743"><span class="ln">5743 </span></a><span class="s0">'NOW,' he whispered.</span>
<a name="l5744"><span class="ln">5744 </span></a><span class="s0">'Not here,' she whispered back.</span>
<a name="l5745"><span class="ln">5745 </span></a><span class="s0">'Come back to the hideout.</span>
<a name="l5746"><span class="ln">5746 </span></a><span class="s0">it was almost as in his dream.</span>
<a name="l5747"><span class="ln">5747 </span></a><span class="s0">Her body gleamed white in the sun.</span>
<a name="l5748"><span class="ln">5748 </span></a><span class="s0">'Have you done this before?' 'Of course.</span>
<a name="l5749"><span class="ln">5749 </span></a><span class="s0">Anything to rot, to weaken, to undermine!</span>
<a name="l5750"><span class="ln">5750 </span></a><span class="s0">The more men you've had, the more I love you.</span>
<a name="l5751"><span class="ln">5751 </span></a><span class="s0">I don't want any virtue to exist anywhere.</span>
<a name="l5752"><span class="ln">5752 </span></a><span class="s0">I'm corrupt to the bones.' 'You like doing this?</span>
<a name="l5753"><span class="ln">5753 </span></a><span class="s0">This time there was no difficulty.</span>
<a name="l5754"><span class="ln">5754 </span></a><span class="s0">The sun seemed to have grown hotter.</span>
<a name="l5755"><span class="ln">5755 </span></a><span class="s0">They were both sleepy.</span>
<a name="l5756"><span class="ln">5756 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston woke first.</span>
<a name="l5757"><span class="ln">5757 </span></a><span class="s0">Except for her mouth, you could not call her beautiful.</span>
<a name="l5758"><span class="ln">5758 </span></a><span class="s0">The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft.</span>
<a name="l5759"><span class="ln">5759 </span></a><span class="s0">Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory.</span>
<a name="l5760"><span class="ln">5760 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a blow struck against the Party.</span>
<a name="l5761"><span class="ln">5761 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a political act.</span>
<a name="l5762"><span class="ln">5762 </span></a><span class="s0">'It's generally safe to use any hide-out twice.</span>
<a name="l5763"><span class="ln">5763 </span></a><span class="s0">It seemed natural to leave this to her.</span>
<a name="l5764"><span class="ln">5764 </span></a><span class="s0">'I'm due back at nineteen-thirty.</span>
<a name="l5765"><span class="ln">5765 </span></a><span class="s0">Isn't it bloody?</span>
<a name="l5766"><span class="ln">5766 </span></a><span class="s0">Give me a brushdown, would you?</span>
<a name="l5767"><span class="ln">5767 </span></a><span class="s0">Have I got any twigs in my hair?</span>
<a name="l5768"><span class="ln">5768 </span></a><span class="s0">Are you sure?</span>
<a name="l5769"><span class="ln">5769 </span></a><span class="s0">A rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand.</span>
<a name="l5770"><span class="ln">5770 </span></a><span class="s0">Even her lips were white.</span>
<a name="l5771"><span class="ln">5771 </span></a><span class="s0">She was dead!</span>
<a name="l5772"><span class="ln">5772 </span></a><span class="s0">Both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster.</span>
<a name="l5773"><span class="ln">5773 </span></a><span class="s0">Julia, in any case, seldom had an evening completely free.</span>
<a name="l5774"><span class="ln">5774 </span></a><span class="s0">It paid, she said, it was camouflage.</span>
<a name="l5775"><span class="ln">5775 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a blazing afternoon.</span>
<a name="l5776"><span class="ln">5776 </span></a><span class="s0">Julia was twenty-six years old.</span>
<a name="l5777"><span class="ln">5777 </span></a><span class="s0">But she was not interested in the finished product.</span>
<a name="l5778"><span class="ln">5778 </span></a><span class="s0">She 'didn't much care for reading,' she said.</span>
<a name="l5779"><span class="ln">5779 </span></a><span class="s0">She had always borne an excellent character.</span>
<a name="l5780"><span class="ln">5780 </span></a><span class="s0">'What are these books like?' said Winston curiously.</span>
<a name="l5781"><span class="ln">5781 </span></a><span class="s0">'Oh, ghastly rubbish.</span>
<a name="l5782"><span class="ln">5782 </span></a><span class="s0">They're boring, really.</span>

<a name="l5971"><span class="ln">5971 </span></a><span class="s0">He thought for a little while.</span>
<a name="l5972"><span class="ln">5972 </span></a><span class="s0">You look normal and innocent.</span>
<a name="l5973"><span class="ln">5973 </span></a><span class="s0">I've thought it all out.</span>

<a name="l5975"><span class="ln">5975 </span></a><span class="s0">And don't be too downhearted.</span>
<a name="l5976"><span class="ln">5976 </span></a><span class="s0">At the end we're certain to be apart.</span>

<a name="l5983"><span class="ln">5983 </span></a><span class="s0">What you say or do doesn't matter: only feelings matter.</span>
<a name="l5984"><span class="ln">5984 </span></a><span class="s0">'They can't do that,' she said finally.</span>
<a name="l5985"><span class="ln">5985 </span></a><span class="s0">'It's the one thing they can't do.</span>
<a name="l5986"><span class="ln">5986 </span></a><span class="s0">They can't get inside you.</span>
<a name="l5987"><span class="ln">5987 </span></a><span class="s0">Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden.</span>

<a name="l5990"><span class="ln">5990 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a sharp snap.</span>
<a name="l5991"><span class="ln">5991 </span></a><span class="s0">The voice had stopped.</span>
<a name="l5992"><span class="ln">5992 </span></a><span class="s0">'You can turn it off!' he said.</span>
<a name="l5993"><span class="ln">5993 </span></a><span class="s0">'Yes,' said O'Brien, 'we can turn it off.</span>
<a name="l5994"><span class="ln">5994 </span></a><span class="s0">We have that privilege.' He was opposite them now.</span>
<a name="l5995"><span class="ln">5995 </span></a><span class="s0">The seconds marched past, enormous.</span>
<a name="l5996"><span class="ln">5996 </span></a><span class="s0">'Shall I say it, or will you?' he said.</span>
<a name="l5997"><span class="ln">5997 </span></a><span class="s0">'I will say it,' said Winston promptly.</span>
<a name="l5998"><span class="ln">5998 </span></a><span class="s0">We want to join it and work for it.</span>
<a name="l5999"><span class="ln">5999 </span></a><span class="s0">We are enemies of the Party.</span>

<a name="l6005"><span class="ln">6005 </span></a><span class="s0">Put them on the round table.</span>
<a name="l6006"><span class="ln">6006 </span></a><span class="s0">Have we enough chairs?</span>
<a name="l6007"><span class="ln">6007 </span></a><span class="s0">Bring a chair for yourself, Martin.</span>
<a name="l6008"><span class="ln">6008 </span></a><span class="s0">This is 216 1984 business.</span>
<a name="l6009"><span class="ln">6009 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye.</span>
<a name="l6010"><span class="ln">6010 </span></a><span class="s0">It had a sour-sweet smell.</span>
<a name="l6011"><span class="ln">6011 </span></a><span class="s0">'It is called wine,' said O'Brien with a faint smile.</span>
<a name="l6012"><span class="ln">6012 </span></a><span class="s0">'You will have read about it in books, no doubt.</span>
<a name="l6013"><span class="ln">6013 </span></a><span class="s0">Wine was a thing he had read and dreamed about.</span>
<a name="l6014"><span class="ln">6014 </span></a><span class="s0">He set down the empty glass.</span>
<a name="l6015"><span class="ln">6015 </span></a><span class="s0">'Then there is such a person as Goldstein?' he said.</span>
<a name="l6016"><span class="ln">6016 </span></a><span class="s0">'Yes, there is such a person, and he is alive.</span>
<a name="l6017"><span class="ln">6017 </span></a><span class="s0">Where, I do not know.' 'And the conspiracy—the organization?</span>
<a name="l6018"><span class="ln">6018 </span></a><span class="s0">Is it real?</span>
<a name="l6019"><span class="ln">6019 </span></a><span class="s0">The Brotherhood, we call it.</span>
<a name="l6020"><span class="ln">6020 </span></a><span class="s0">You, comrade'—he bowed his head to Julia—'will leave first.</span>
<a name="l6021"><span class="ln">6021 </span></a><span class="s0">We have about twenty minutes at our disposal.</span>
<a name="l6022"><span class="ln">6022 </span></a><span class="s0">For a moment the lids flitted down over his eyes.</span>
<a name="l6023"><span class="ln">6023 </span></a><span class="s0">'No,' he said finally.</span>
<a name="l6024"><span class="ln">6024 </span></a><span class="s0">'You did well to tell me,' said O'Brien.</span>
<a name="l6025"><span class="ln">6025 </span></a><span class="s0">We may be obliged to give him a new identity.</span>
<a name="l6026"><span class="ln">6026 </span></a><span class="s0">And you yourself might have become a different person.</span>
<a name="l6027"><span class="ln">6027 </span></a><span class="s0">Our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition.</span>
<a name="l6028"><span class="ln">6028 </span></a><span class="s0">Sometimes it is necessary.</span>
<a name="l6029"><span class="ln">6029 </span></a><span class="s0">There were no scars that he could see.</span>
<a name="l6030"><span class="ln">6030 </span></a><span class="s0">She murmured something that seemed to be assent.</span>
<a name="l6031"><span class="ln">6031 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien looked at his wrist-watch again.</span>
<a name="l6032"><span class="ln">6032 </span></a><span class="s0">'I shall switch on in a quarter of an hour.</span>
<a name="l6033"><span class="ln">6033 </span></a><span class="s0">You will be seeing them again.</span>
<a name="l6034"><span class="ln">6034 </span></a><span class="s0">There was not a trace of friendliness in his manner.</span>
<a name="l6035"><span class="ln">6035 </span></a><span class="s0">You will always be in the dark.</span>
<a name="l6036"><span class="ln">6036 </span></a><span class="s0">When you receive orders, they will come from me.</span>
<a name="l6037"><span class="ln">6037 </span></a><span class="s0">When you are finally caught, you will confess.</span>
<a name="l6038"><span class="ln">6038 </span></a><span class="s0">That is unavoidable.</span>
<a name="l6039"><span class="ln">6039 </span></a><span class="s0">Probably you will not even betray me.</span>
<a name="l6040"><span class="ln">6040 </span></a><span class="s0">Even Julia 222 1984 seemed to be impressed.</span>
<a name="l6041"><span class="ln">6041 </span></a><span class="s0">No doubt you have formed your own picture of it.</span>
<a name="l6042"><span class="ln">6042 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing of the kind exists.</span>
<a name="l6043"><span class="ln">6043 </span></a><span class="s0">No such list exists.</span>
<a name="l6044"><span class="ln">6044 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible.</span>
<a name="l6045"><span class="ln">6045 </span></a><span class="s0">You will get no comradeship and no encouragement.</span>
<a name="l6046"><span class="ln">6046 </span></a><span class="s0">When finally you are caught, you will get no help.</span>
<a name="l6047"><span class="ln">6047 </span></a><span class="s0">We never help our members.</span>
<a name="l6048"><span class="ln">6048 </span></a><span class="s0">Those are the only results that you will ever see.</span>
<a name="l6049"><span class="ln">6049 </span></a><span class="s0">We are the dead.</span>
<a name="l6050"><span class="ln">6050 </span></a><span class="s0">Our only true life is in the future.</span>
<a name="l6051"><span class="ln">6051 </span></a><span class="s0">It might be a thousand years.</span>
<a name="l6052"><span class="ln">6052 </span></a><span class="s0">We cannot act collectively.</span>
<a name="l6053"><span class="ln">6053 </span></a><span class="s0">'To the confusion of the Thought Police?</span>
<a name="l6054"><span class="ln">6054 </span></a><span class="s0">To the death of Big Brother?</span>
<a name="l6055"><span class="ln">6055 </span></a><span class="s0">To the future?' 'To the past,' said Winston.</span>
<a name="l6056"><span class="ln">6056 </span></a><span class="s0">'The past is more important,' agreed O'Brien gravely.</span>
<a name="l6057"><span class="ln">6057 </span></a><span class="s0">'There are details to be settled,' he said.</span>
<a name="l6058"><span class="ln">6058 </span></a><span class="s0">'That will do for the moment.</span>
<a name="l6059"><span class="ln">6059 </span></a><span class="s0">Later we will arrange something else for you.</span>
<a name="l6060"><span class="ln">6060 </span></a><span class="s0">It is important to change one's hiding-place frequently.</span>
<a name="l6061"><span class="ln">6061 </span></a><span class="s0">There are not many in existence, as you can imagine.</span>
<a name="l6062"><span class="ln">6062 </span></a><span class="s0">It makes very little difference.</span>
<a name="l6063"><span class="ln">6063 </span></a><span class="s0">The book is indestructible.</span>
<a name="l6064"><span class="ln">6064 </span></a><span class="s0">With two straps.' 'Black, two straps, very shabby—good.</span>
<a name="l6065"><span class="ln">6065 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien nodded without appearance of surprise.</span>
<a name="l6066"><span class="ln">6066 </span></a><span class="s0">Any question?.' Winston thought.</span>
<a name="l6067"><span class="ln">6067 </span></a><span class="s0">'Yes, I knew the last line.</span>
<a name="l6068"><span class="ln">6068 </span></a><span class="s0">His powerful grip crushed the bones of Winston's palm.</span>
<a name="l6069"><span class="ln">6069 </span></a><span class="s0">The incident was closed.</span>
<a name="l6070"><span class="ln">6070 </span></a><span class="s0">Gelatinous was the right word.</span>
<a name="l6071"><span class="ln">6071 </span></a><span class="s0">It had come into his head spontaneously.</span>
<a name="l6072"><span class="ln">6072 </span></a><span class="s0">All sensations seemed to be magnified.</span>
<a name="l6073"><span class="ln">6073 </span></a><span class="s0">He had worked more than ninety hours in five days.</span>
<a name="l6074"><span class="ln">6074 </span></a><span class="s0">So had everyone else in the Ministry.</span>
<a name="l6075"><span class="ln">6075 </span></a><span class="s0">Oceania was at war with Eastasia.</span>
<a name="l6076"><span class="ln">6076 </span></a><span class="s0">Eurasia was an ally.</span>
<a name="l6077"><span class="ln">6077 </span></a><span class="s0">The most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren.</span>
<a name="l6078"><span class="ln">6078 </span></a><span class="s0">He unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech.</span>
<a name="l6079"><span class="ln">6079 </span></a><span class="s0">Oceania was at war with Eastasia!</span>
<a name="l6080"><span class="ln">6080 </span></a><span class="s0">The next moment there was a tremendous commotion.</span>
<a name="l6081"><span class="ln">6081 </span></a><span class="s0">Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them.</span>
<a name="l6082"><span class="ln">6082 </span></a><span class="s0">It was sabotage!</span>
<a name="l6083"><span class="ln">6083 </span></a><span class="s0">The agents of Goldstein had been at work!</span>
<a name="l6084"><span class="ln">6084 </span></a><span class="s0">But within two or three minutes it was all over.</span>
<a name="l6085"><span class="ln">6085 </span></a><span class="s0">The entire staff of the Ministry had done likewise.</span>
<a name="l6086"><span class="ln">6086 </span></a><span class="s0">He was tired, but not sleepy any longer.</span>
<a name="l6087"><span class="ln">6087 </span></a><span class="s0">Julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was the book.</span>
<a name="l6088"><span class="ln">6088 </span></a><span class="s0">The print also looked slightly irregular.</span>
<a name="l6089"><span class="ln">6089 </span></a><span class="s0">The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable...</span>
<a name="l6090"><span class="ln">6090 </span></a><span class="s0">The sweet summer air played against his cheek.</span>
<a name="l6091"><span class="ln">6091 </span></a><span class="s0">It was bliss, it was etemity.</span>
<a name="l6092"><span class="ln">6092 </span></a><span class="s0">War has in fact changed its character.</span>
<a name="l6093"><span class="ln">6093 </span></a><span class="s0">Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still there.</span>
<a name="l6094"><span class="ln">6094 </span></a><span class="s0">If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction.</span>

<a name="l6100"><span class="ln">6100 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing is efficient in Oceania except the Thought Police.</span>
<a name="l6101"><span class="ln">6101 </span></a><span class="s0">But though it is unreal it is not meaningless.</span>
<a name="l6102"><span class="ln">6102 </span></a><span class="s0">The very word 'war', therefore, has become misleading.</span>
<a name="l6103"><span class="ln">6103 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston stopped reading for a moment.</span>
<a name="l6104"><span class="ln">6104 </span></a><span class="s0">Somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thundered.</span>
<a name="l6105"><span class="ln">6105 </span></a><span class="s0">The book fascinated him, or more exactly it reassured him.</span>
<a name="l6106"><span class="ln">6106 </span></a><span class="s0">'I've got THE BOOK,' he said as they disentangled themselves.</span>
<a name="l6107"><span class="ln">6107 </span></a><span class="s0">'Oh, you've got it?</span>
<a name="l6108"><span class="ln">6108 </span></a><span class="s0">'We must read it,' he said.</span>

<a name="l6158"><span class="ln">6158 </span></a><span class="s0">It might easily be fifteen.</span>
<a name="l6159"><span class="ln">6159 </span></a><span class="s0">At the end of it she was still singing.</span>
<a name="l6160"><span class="ln">6160 </span></a><span class="s0">If there was hope, it lay in the proles!</span>
<a name="l6161"><span class="ln">6161 </span></a><span class="s0">The future belonged to the proles.</span>
<a name="l6162"><span class="ln">6162 </span></a><span class="s0">Where there is equality there can be sanity.</span>
<a name="l6163"><span class="ln">6163 </span></a><span class="s0">In the end their awakening would come.</span>
<a name="l6164"><span class="ln">6164 </span></a><span class="s0">'He was singing to please himself.</span>
<a name="l6165"><span class="ln">6165 </span></a><span class="s0">Not even that.</span>
<a name="l6166"><span class="ln">6166 </span></a><span class="s0">He was just singing.' The birds sang, the proles sang.</span>
<a name="l6167"><span class="ln">6167 </span></a><span class="s0">the Party did not sing.</span>
<a name="l6168"><span class="ln">6168 </span></a><span class="s0">You were the dead, theirs was the future.</span>
<a name="l6169"><span class="ln">6169 </span></a><span class="s0">'We are the dead,' he said.</span>
<a name="l6170"><span class="ln">6170 </span></a><span class="s0">'We are the dead,' echoed Julia dutifully.</span>
<a name="l6171"><span class="ln">6171 </span></a><span class="s0">'You are the dead,' said an iron voice behind them.</span>
<a name="l6172"><span class="ln">6172 </span></a><span class="s0">They sprang apart.</span>
<a name="l6173"><span class="ln">6173 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston's entrails seemed to have turned into ice.</span>
<a name="l6174"><span class="ln">6174 </span></a><span class="s0">Her face had turned a milky yellow.</span>
<a name="l6175"><span class="ln">6175 </span></a><span class="s0">'You are the dead,' repeated the iron voice.</span>
<a name="l6176"><span class="ln">6176 </span></a><span class="s0">'It was behind the picture,' breathed Julia.</span>
<a name="l6177"><span class="ln">6177 </span></a><span class="s0">'It was behind the picture,' said the voice.</span>
<a name="l6178"><span class="ln">6178 </span></a><span class="s0">'Remain exactly where you are.</span>
<a name="l6179"><span class="ln">6179 </span></a><span class="s0">Unthinkable to disobey the iron voice from the wall.</span>
<a name="l6180"><span class="ln">6180 </span></a><span class="s0">'Now they can see us,' said Julia.</span>
<a name="l6181"><span class="ln">6181 </span></a><span class="s0">'Now we can see you,' said the voice.</span>
<a name="l6182"><span class="ln">6182 </span></a><span class="s0">'Stand out in the middle of the room.</span>
<a name="l6183"><span class="ln">6183 </span></a><span class="s0">Stand back to back.</span>
<a name="l6184"><span class="ln">6184 </span></a><span class="s0">Clasp your hands behind your heads.</span>
<a name="l6185"><span class="ln">6185 </span></a><span class="s0">Or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own.</span>
<a name="l6186"><span class="ln">6186 </span></a><span class="s0">The yard seemed to be full of men.</span>
<a name="l6187"><span class="ln">6187 </span></a><span class="s0">Something was being dragged across the stones.</span>
<a name="l6188"><span class="ln">6188 </span></a><span class="s0">The woman's singing had stopped abruptly.</span>
<a name="l6189"><span class="ln">6189 </span></a><span class="s0">'The house is surrounded,' said Winston.</span>
<a name="l6190"><span class="ln">6190 </span></a><span class="s0">280 1984 'The house is surrounded,' said the voice.</span>
<a name="l6191"><span class="ln">6191 </span></a><span class="s0">He heard Julia snap her teeth together.</span>
<a name="l6192"><span class="ln">6192 </span></a><span class="s0">'I suppose we may as well say good-bye,' she said.</span>
<a name="l6193"><span class="ln">6193 </span></a><span class="s0">'You may as well say good-bye,' said the voice.</span>
<a name="l6194"><span class="ln">6194 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone was climbing through the window.</span>
<a name="l6195"><span class="ln">6195 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a stampede of boots up the stairs.</span>
<a name="l6196"><span class="ln">6196 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston was not trembling any longer.</span>
<a name="l6197"><span class="ln">6197 </span></a><span class="s0">Even his eyes he barely moved.</span>
<a name="l6198"><span class="ln">6198 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston met his eyes.</span>
<a name="l6199"><span class="ln">6199 </span></a><span class="s0">There was another crash.</span>
<a name="l6200"><span class="ln">6200 </span></a><span class="s0">How small, thought Winston, how small it always was!</span>
<a name="l6201"><span class="ln">6201 </span></a><span class="s0">She was thrashing about on the floor, fighting for breath.</span>
<a name="l6202"><span class="ln">6202 </span></a><span class="s0">He stood dead still.</span>
<a name="l6203"><span class="ln">6203 </span></a><span class="s0">No one had hit him yet.</span>
<a name="l6204"><span class="ln">6204 </span></a><span class="s0">He wondered whether they had got Mr Charrington.</span>
<a name="l6205"><span class="ln">6205 </span></a><span class="s0">But the light seemed too strong.</span>
<a name="l6206"><span class="ln">6206 </span></a><span class="s0">But he did not pursue the thought further.</span>
<a name="l6207"><span class="ln">6207 </span></a><span class="s0">It was not interesting.</span>
<a name="l6208"><span class="ln">6208 </span></a><span class="s0">There ws another, lighter step in the passage.</span>
<a name="l6209"><span class="ln">6209 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr Charrington came into the room.</span>
<a name="l6210"><span class="ln">6210 </span></a><span class="s0">The demeanour of the black-uniformed men suddenly became more subdued.</span>
<a name="l6211"><span class="ln">6211 </span></a><span class="s0">Something had also changed in Mr Charrington's appearance.</span>
<a name="l6212"><span class="ln">6212 </span></a><span class="s0">His eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight.</span>
<a name="l6213"><span class="ln">6213 </span></a><span class="s0">'Pick up those pieces,' he said sharply.</span>
<a name="l6214"><span class="ln">6214 </span></a><span class="s0">A man stooped to obey.</span>
<a name="l6215"><span class="ln">6215 </span></a><span class="s0">Also he was not wearing his spectacles.</span>
<a name="l6216"><span class="ln">6216 </span></a><span class="s0">His body had straightened, and seemed to have grown bigger.</span>
<a name="l6217"><span class="ln">6217 </span></a><span class="s0">There were four telescreens, one in each wall.</span>
<a name="l6218"><span class="ln">6218 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a dull aching in his belly.</span>
<a name="l6219"><span class="ln">6219 </span></a><span class="s0">Since he was arrested he had not been fed.</span>
<a name="l6220"><span class="ln">6220 </span></a><span class="s0">He had already learned to sit still.</span>
<a name="l6221"><span class="ln">6221 </span></a><span class="s0">But the craving for food was growing upon him.</span>
<a name="l6222"><span class="ln">6222 </span></a><span class="s0">'Smith!' yelled a voice from the telescreen.</span>
<a name="l6223"><span class="ln">6223 </span></a><span class="s0">'6079 Smith W.!</span>
<a name="l6224"><span class="ln">6224 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a noisy, evilsmelling place.</span>
<a name="l6225"><span class="ln">6225 </span></a><span class="s0">All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals.</span>
<a name="l6226"><span class="ln">6226 </span></a><span class="s0">288 1984 'Beg pardon, dearie,' she said.</span>
<a name="l6227"><span class="ln">6227 </span></a><span class="s0">'Thass better,' she said, leaning back with closed eyes.</span>
<a name="l6228"><span class="ln">6228 </span></a><span class="s0">'Never keep it down, thass what I say.</span>
<a name="l6229"><span class="ln">6229 </span></a><span class="s0">'Wass your name, dearie?' she said.</span>
<a name="l6230"><span class="ln">6230 </span></a><span class="s0">'Smith,' said Winston.</span>
<a name="l6231"><span class="ln">6231 </span></a><span class="s0">'Smith?' said the woman.</span>
<a name="l6232"><span class="ln">6232 </span></a><span class="s0">My name's Smith too.</span>
<a name="l6233"><span class="ln">6233 </span></a><span class="s0">No one else had spoken to him.</span>
<a name="l6234"><span class="ln">6234 </span></a><span class="s0">When it grew better, panic took hold of him.</span>
<a name="l6235"><span class="ln">6235 </span></a><span class="s0">He hardly thought of Julia.</span>
<a name="l6236"><span class="ln">6236 </span></a><span class="s0">He could not fix his mind on her.</span>
<a name="l6237"><span class="ln">6237 </span></a><span class="s0">He thought oftener of O'Brien, with a flickering hope.</span>
<a name="l6238"><span class="ln">6238 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien might know that he had been arrested.</span>
<a name="l6239"><span class="ln">6239 </span></a><span class="s0">In the Ministry of Love there were no windows.</span>
<a name="l6240"><span class="ln">6240 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a sound of marching boots outside.</span>
<a name="l6241"><span class="ln">6241 </span></a><span class="s0">The steel door opened with a clang.</span>
<a name="l6242"><span class="ln">6242 </span></a><span class="s0">The poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell.</span>
<a name="l6243"><span class="ln">6243 </span></a><span class="s0">The door clanged shut again.</span>
<a name="l6244"><span class="ln">6244 </span></a><span class="s0">He had not yet noticed Winston's presence.</span>
<a name="l6245"><span class="ln">6245 </span></a><span class="s0">He was also several days away from a shave.</span>
<a name="l6246"><span class="ln">6246 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston roused hirnself a little from his lethargy.</span>
<a name="l6247"><span class="ln">6247 </span></a><span class="s0">'Ampleforth,' he said.</span>
<a name="l6248"><span class="ln">6248 </span></a><span class="s0">There was no yell from the telescreen.</span>
<a name="l6249"><span class="ln">6249 </span></a><span class="s0">Ampleforth paused, mildly startled.</span>
<a name="l6250"><span class="ln">6250 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyes focused themselves slowly on Winston.</span>
<a name="l6251"><span class="ln">6251 </span></a><span class="s0">'Ah, Smith!' he said.</span>
<a name="l6252"><span class="ln">6252 </span></a><span class="s0">'There is only one offence, is there not?' he said.</span>
<a name="l6253"><span class="ln">6253 </span></a><span class="s0">'These things happen,' he began vaguely.</span>
<a name="l6254"><span class="ln">6254 </span></a><span class="s0">'I have been able to recall one instance—a possible instance.</span>
<a name="l6255"><span class="ln">6255 </span></a><span class="s0">It was an indiscretion, undoubtedly.</span>
<a name="l6256"><span class="ln">6256 </span></a><span class="s0">'It was impossible to change the line.</span>
<a name="l6257"><span class="ln">6257 </span></a><span class="s0">The rhyme was 'rod”.</span>
<a name="l6258"><span class="ln">6258 </span></a><span class="s0">For days I had racked my brains.</span>
<a name="l6259"><span class="ln">6259 </span></a><span class="s0">Ampleforth looked startled again.</span>
<a name="l6260"><span class="ln">6260 </span></a><span class="s0">'I had hardly thought about it.</span>
<a name="l6261"><span class="ln">6261 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston sat quietly, his hands crossed.</span>
<a name="l6262"><span class="ln">6262 </span></a><span class="s0">Twenty minutes, an hour—it was difficult to judge.</span>
<a name="l6263"><span class="ln">6263 </span></a><span class="s0">Once more there was a sound of boots outside.</span>
<a name="l6264"><span class="ln">6264 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston's entrails contracted.</span>
<a name="l6265"><span class="ln">6265 </span></a><span class="s0">The door opened.</span>
<a name="l6266"><span class="ln">6266 </span></a><span class="s0">The cold-faced young officer stepped into the cell.</span>
<a name="l6267"><span class="ln">6267 </span></a><span class="s0">With a brief movement of the hand he indicated Ampleforth.</span>
<a name="l6268"><span class="ln">6268 </span></a><span class="s0">'Room 101,' he said.</span>
<a name="l6269"><span class="ln">6269 </span></a><span class="s0">What seemed like a long time passed.</span>
<a name="l6270"><span class="ln">6270 </span></a><span class="s0">The pain in Winston's belly had revived.</span>
<a name="l6271"><span class="ln">6271 </span></a><span class="s0">He had only six thoughts.</span>
<a name="l6272"><span class="ln">6272 </span></a><span class="s0">Parsons walked into the cell.</span>
<a name="l6273"><span class="ln">6273 </span></a><span class="s0">He was wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.</span>
<a name="l6274"><span class="ln">6274 </span></a><span class="s0">This time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.</span>
<a name="l6275"><span class="ln">6275 </span></a><span class="s0">'YOU here!' he said.</span>
<a name="l6276"><span class="ln">6276 </span></a><span class="s0">'What are you in for?' said Winston.</span>
<a name="l6277"><span class="ln">6277 </span></a><span class="s0">'Thoughtcrime!' said Parsons, almost blubbering.</span>
<a name="l6278"><span class="ln">6278 </span></a><span class="s0">I know they give you a fair hearing.</span>
<a name="l6279"><span class="ln">6279 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh, I trust them for that!</span>
<a name="l6280"><span class="ln">6280 </span></a><span class="s0">They'll know my record, won't they?</span>
<a name="l6281"><span class="ln">6281 </span></a><span class="s0">YOU know what kind of chap I was.</span>
<a name="l6282"><span class="ln">6282 </span></a><span class="s0">Not a bad chap in my way.</span>
<a name="l6283"><span class="ln">6283 </span></a><span class="s0">Not brainy, of course, but keen.</span>
<a name="l6284"><span class="ln">6284 </span></a><span class="s0">I'll get off with five years, don't you think?</span>
<a name="l6285"><span class="ln">6285 </span></a><span class="s0">Or even ten years?</span>
<a name="l6286"><span class="ln">6286 </span></a><span class="s0">'Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,' he said sententiously.</span>
<a name="l6287"><span class="ln">6287 </span></a><span class="s0">Do you know how it got hold of me?</span>
<a name="l6288"><span class="ln">6288 </span></a><span class="s0">In my sleep!</span>
<a name="l6289"><span class="ln">6289 </span></a><span class="s0">Yes, that's a fact.</span>
<a name="l6290"><span class="ln">6290 </span></a><span class="s0">And then I started talking in my sleep.</span>
<a name="l6291"><span class="ln">6291 </span></a><span class="s0">''Down with Big Brother!' Yes, I said that!</span>
<a name="l6292"><span class="ln">6292 </span></a><span class="s0">Said it over and over again, it seems.</span>
<a name="l6293"><span class="ln">6293 </span></a><span class="s0">'She listened at the keyhole.</span>
<a name="l6294"><span class="ln">6294 </span></a><span class="s0">Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?</span>
<a name="l6295"><span class="ln">6295 </span></a><span class="s0">I don't bear her any grudge for it.</span>
<a name="l6296"><span class="ln">6296 </span></a><span class="s0">In fact I'm proud of her.</span>
<a name="l6297"><span class="ln">6297 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he suddenly ripped down his shorts.</span>
<a name="l6298"><span class="ln">6298 </span></a><span class="s0">'Excuse me, old man,' he said.</span>
<a name="l6299"><span class="ln">6299 </span></a><span class="s0">'I can't help it.</span>
<a name="l6300"><span class="ln">6300 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston covered his face with his hands.</span>
<a name="l6301"><span class="ln">6301 </span></a><span class="s0">'Smith!' yelled the voice from the telescreen.</span>
<a name="l6302"><span class="ln">6302 </span></a><span class="s0">'6079 Smith W!</span>
<a name="l6303"><span class="ln">6303 </span></a><span class="s0">Uncover your face.</span>
<a name="l6304"><span class="ln">6304 </span></a><span class="s0">No faces covered in the cells.' Winston uncovered his face.</span>
<a name="l6305"><span class="ln">6305 </span></a><span class="s0">Parsons used the lavatory, loudly and abundantly.</span>
<a name="l6306"><span class="ln">6306 </span></a><span class="s0">Parsons was removed.</span>
<a name="l6307"><span class="ln">6307 </span></a><span class="s0">More prisoners came and went, 296 1984 mysteriously.</span>
<a name="l6308"><span class="ln">6308 </span></a><span class="s0">There were six prisoners in the cell, men and women.</span>
<a name="l6309"><span class="ln">6309 </span></a><span class="s0">All sat very still.</span>
<a name="l6310"><span class="ln">6310 </span></a><span class="s0">But what was startling was the emaciation of his face.</span>
<a name="l6311"><span class="ln">6311 </span></a><span class="s0">It was like a skull.</span>
<a name="l6312"><span class="ln">6312 </span></a><span class="s0">Suddenly he realized what was the matter.</span>
<a name="l6313"><span class="ln">6313 </span></a><span class="s0">The man was dying of starvation.</span>
<a name="l6314"><span class="ln">6314 </span></a><span class="s0">Presently he began to fidget on his seat.</span>
<a name="l6315"><span class="ln">6315 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen.</span>
<a name="l6316"><span class="ln">6316 </span></a><span class="s0">The chinless man jumped in his tracks.</span>
<a name="l6317"><span class="ln">6317 </span></a><span class="s0">'Bumstead!' roared the voice.</span>
<a name="l6318"><span class="ln">6318 </span></a><span class="s0">'2713 Bumstead J.!</span>
<a name="l6319"><span class="ln">6319 </span></a><span class="s0">'Remain standing where you are,' said the voice.</span>
<a name="l6320"><span class="ln">6320 </span></a><span class="s0">'Face the door.</span>
<a name="l6321"><span class="ln">6321 </span></a><span class="s0">Make no movement.' The chinless man obeyed.</span>
<a name="l6322"><span class="ln">6322 </span></a><span class="s0">His large pouchy cheeks were quivering uncontrollably.</span>
<a name="l6323"><span class="ln">6323 </span></a><span class="s0">The door clanged open.</span>
<a name="l6324"><span class="ln">6324 </span></a><span class="s0">The chinless man climbed back into his place.</span>
<a name="l6325"><span class="ln">6325 </span></a><span class="s0">Down one side of his face the flesh was darkening.</span>
<a name="l6326"><span class="ln">6326 </span></a><span class="s0">The door opened.</span>
<a name="l6327"><span class="ln">6327 </span></a><span class="s0">With a small gesture the officer indicated the skull-faced man.</span>
<a name="l6328"><span class="ln">6328 </span></a><span class="s0">'Room 101,' he said.</span>
<a name="l6329"><span class="ln">6329 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a gasp and a flurry at Winston's side.</span>
<a name="l6330"><span class="ln">6330 </span></a><span class="s0">Officer!' he cried.</span>
<a name="l6331"><span class="ln">6331 </span></a><span class="s0">'You don't have to take me to that place!</span>
<a name="l6332"><span class="ln">6332 </span></a><span class="s0">Haven't I told you everything already?</span>
<a name="l6333"><span class="ln">6333 </span></a><span class="s0">What else is it you want to know?</span>
<a name="l6334"><span class="ln">6334 </span></a><span class="s0">There's nothing I wouldn't confess, nothing!</span>
<a name="l6335"><span class="ln">6335 </span></a><span class="s0">Write it down and I'll sign it—anything!</span>
<a name="l6336"><span class="ln">6336 </span></a><span class="s0">Not room 101!' 'Room 101,' said the officer.</span>
<a name="l6337"><span class="ln">6337 </span></a><span class="s0">It was definitely, unmistakably, a shade of green.</span>
<a name="l6338"><span class="ln">6338 </span></a><span class="s0">'Do anything to me!' he yelled.</span>
<a name="l6339"><span class="ln">6339 </span></a><span class="s0">Finish it off and let me die.</span>
<a name="l6340"><span class="ln">6340 </span></a><span class="s0">Sentence me to twenty-five years.</span>
<a name="l6341"><span class="ln">6341 </span></a><span class="s0">Is there somebody else you want me to give away?</span>
<a name="l6342"><span class="ln">6342 </span></a><span class="s0">I've got a wife and three children.</span>
<a name="l6343"><span class="ln">6343 </span></a><span class="s0">The biggest of them isn't six years old.</span>
<a name="l6344"><span class="ln">6344 </span></a><span class="s0">But not Room 101!' 'Room 101,' said the officer.</span>
<a name="l6345"><span class="ln">6345 </span></a><span class="s0">He flung out a lean arm.</span>
<a name="l6346"><span class="ln">6346 </span></a><span class="s0">The man's voice rose to a shriek.</span>
<a name="l6347"><span class="ln">6347 </span></a><span class="s0">'You didn't hear him!' he repeated.</span>
<a name="l6348"><span class="ln">6348 </span></a><span class="s0">'Something went wrong with the telescreen.</span>
<a name="l6349"><span class="ln">6349 </span></a><span class="s0">HE'S the one you want.</span>
<a name="l6350"><span class="ln">6350 </span></a><span class="s0">He had set up a wordless howling, like an animal.</span>
<a name="l6351"><span class="ln">6351 </span></a><span class="s0">For perhaps twenty seconds they were hauling at him.</span>
<a name="l6352"><span class="ln">6352 </span></a><span class="s0">Then there was a different kind of cry.</span>
<a name="l6353"><span class="ln">6353 </span></a><span class="s0">They dragged him to his feet.</span>
<a name="l6354"><span class="ln">6354 </span></a><span class="s0">'Room 101,' said the officer.</span>
<a name="l6355"><span class="ln">6355 </span></a><span class="s0">A long time passed.</span>
<a name="l6356"><span class="ln">6356 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston was alone, and had been alone for hours.</span>
<a name="l6357"><span class="ln">6357 </span></a><span class="s0">His mouth was sticky and evil-tasting.</span>
<a name="l6358"><span class="ln">6358 </span></a><span class="s0">More dimly he thought of Julia.</span>
<a name="l6359"><span class="ln">6359 </span></a><span class="s0">She might be screaming with pain at this moment.</span>
<a name="l6360"><span class="ln">6360 </span></a><span class="s0">He did not feel it.</span>
<a name="l6361"><span class="ln">6361 </span></a><span class="s0">But that question was not answerable yet.</span>
<a name="l6362"><span class="ln">6362 </span></a><span class="s0">The boots were approaching again.</span>
<a name="l6363"><span class="ln">6363 </span></a><span class="s0">The door opened.</span>
<a name="l6364"><span class="ln">6364 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien came in.</span>
<a name="l6365"><span class="ln">6365 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston started to his feet.</span>
<a name="l6366"><span class="ln">6366 </span></a><span class="s0">'They've got you too!' he cried.</span>
<a name="l6367"><span class="ln">6367 </span></a><span class="s0">He stepped aside.</span>
<a name="l6368"><span class="ln">6368 </span></a><span class="s0">'You know this, Winston,' said O'Brien.</span>
<a name="l6369"><span class="ln">6369 </span></a><span class="s0">'Don't deceive yourself.</span>
<a name="l6370"><span class="ln">6370 </span></a><span class="s0">But there was no time to think of that.</span>
<a name="l6371"><span class="ln">6371 </span></a><span class="s0">Everything had exploded into yellow light.</span>
<a name="l6372"><span class="ln">6372 </span></a><span class="s0">Inconceivable, inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain!</span>
<a name="l6373"><span class="ln">6373 </span></a><span class="s0">The guard was laughing at his contortions.</span>
<a name="l6374"><span class="ln">6374 </span></a><span class="s0">One question at any rate was answered.</span>
<a name="l6375"><span class="ln">6375 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain.</span>
<a name="l6376"><span class="ln">6376 </span></a><span class="s0">Besides, his memories were not continuous.</span>
<a name="l6377"><span class="ln">6377 </span></a><span class="s0">I must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable.</span>
<a name="l6378"><span class="ln">6378 </span></a><span class="s0">It was easier to confess everything and implicate everybody.</span>
<a name="l6379"><span class="ln">6379 </span></a><span class="s0">Besides, in a sense it was all true.</span>
<a name="l6380"><span class="ln">6380 </span></a><span class="s0">There were also memories of another kind.</span>
<a name="l6381"><span class="ln">6381 </span></a><span class="s0">The eyes grew larger and more luminous.</span>
<a name="l6382"><span class="ln">6382 </span></a><span class="s0">A man in a white coat was reading the dials.</span>
<a name="l6383"><span class="ln">6383 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a tramp of heavy boots outside.</span>
<a name="l6384"><span class="ln">6384 </span></a><span class="s0">The door clanged open.</span>
<a name="l6385"><span class="ln">6385 </span></a><span class="s0">The waxed-faced officer marched in, followed by two guards.</span>
<a name="l6386"><span class="ln">6386 </span></a><span class="s0">'Room 101,' said the officer.</span>
<a name="l6387"><span class="ln">6387 </span></a><span class="s0">The man in the white coat did not turn round.</span>
<a name="l6388"><span class="ln">6388 </span></a><span class="s0">It was O'Brien who was directing everything.</span>
<a name="l6389"><span class="ln">6389 </span></a><span class="s0">For seven years I have watched over you.</span>
<a name="l6390"><span class="ln">6390 </span></a><span class="s0">Now the turning-point has come.</span>
<a name="l6391"><span class="ln">6391 </span></a><span class="s0">He did not remember any ending to his interrogation.</span>
<a name="l6392"><span class="ln">6392 </span></a><span class="s0">His body was held down at every essential point.</span>
<a name="l6393"><span class="ln">6393 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien was looking down at him gravely and rather sadly.</span>
<a name="l6394"><span class="ln">6394 </span></a><span class="s0">Your especial fear is that it will be your backbone.</span>
<a name="l6395"><span class="ln">6395 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien drew back the lever on 310 1984 the dial.</span>
<a name="l6396"><span class="ln">6396 </span></a><span class="s0">'That was forty,' said O'Brien.</span>
<a name="l6397"><span class="ln">6397 </span></a><span class="s0">Do you understand that?' 'Yes,' said Winston.</span>
<a name="l6398"><span class="ln">6398 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien's manner became less severe.</span>
<a name="l6399"><span class="ln">6399 </span></a><span class="s0">When he spoke his voice was gentle and patient.</span>
<a name="l6400"><span class="ln">6400 </span></a><span class="s0">You know perfectly well what is the matter with you.</span>
<a name="l6401"><span class="ln">6401 </span></a><span class="s0">You are mentally deranged.</span>
<a name="l6402"><span class="ln">6402 </span></a><span class="s0">You suffer from a defective memory.</span>
<a name="l6403"><span class="ln">6403 </span></a><span class="s0">Fortunately it is curable.</span>
<a name="l6404"><span class="ln">6404 </span></a><span class="s0">Now we will take an example.</span>
<a name="l6405"><span class="ln">6405 </span></a><span class="s0">He could not take his eyes away from the dial.</span>
<a name="l6406"><span class="ln">6406 </span></a><span class="s0">'The truth, please, Winston.</span>
<a name="l6407"><span class="ln">6407 </span></a><span class="s0">We were in alliance with them.</span>
<a name="l6408"><span class="ln">6408 </span></a><span class="s0">The war was against Eurasia.</span>
<a name="l6409"><span class="ln">6409 </span></a><span class="s0">That had lasted for four years.</span>
<a name="l6410"><span class="ln">6410 </span></a><span class="s0">'Another example,' he said.</span>
<a name="l6411"><span class="ln">6411 </span></a><span class="s0">'Some years ago you had a very serious delusion indeed.</span>
<a name="l6412"><span class="ln">6412 </span></a><span class="s0">It was THE photograph.</span>
<a name="l6413"><span class="ln">6413 </span></a><span class="s0">But he had seen it, unquestionably he had seen it!</span>
<a name="l6414"><span class="ln">6414 </span></a><span class="s0">For the moment he had even forgotten the dial.</span>
<a name="l6415"><span class="ln">6415 </span></a><span class="s0">'It exists!' he cried.</span>
<a name="l6416"><span class="ln">6416 </span></a><span class="s0">'No,' said O'Brien.</span>
<a name="l6417"><span class="ln">6417 </span></a><span class="s0">He stepped across the room.</span>
<a name="l6418"><span class="ln">6418 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a memory hole in the opposite wall.</span>
<a name="l6419"><span class="ln">6419 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien lifted the grating.</span>
<a name="l6420"><span class="ln">6420 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien turned away from the wall.</span>
<a name="l6421"><span class="ln">6421 </span></a><span class="s0">'Ashes,' he said.</span>
<a name="l6422"><span class="ln">6422 </span></a><span class="s0">'Not even identifiable ashes.</span>
<a name="l6423"><span class="ln">6423 </span></a><span class="s0">It does not exist.</span>
<a name="l6424"><span class="ln">6424 </span></a><span class="s0">It never existed.' 'But it did exist!</span>
<a name="l6425"><span class="ln">6425 </span></a><span class="s0">It does exist!</span>
<a name="l6426"><span class="ln">6426 </span></a><span class="s0">It exists in memory.</span>
<a name="l6427"><span class="ln">6427 </span></a><span class="s0">I remember it.</span>
<a name="l6428"><span class="ln">6428 </span></a><span class="s0">You remember it.' 'I do not remember it,' said O'Brien.</span>
<a name="l6429"><span class="ln">6429 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston's heart sank.</span>
<a name="l6430"><span class="ln">6430 </span></a><span class="s0">That was doublethink.</span>
<a name="l6431"><span class="ln">6431 </span></a><span class="s0">He had a feeling of deadly helplessness.</span>
<a name="l6432"><span class="ln">6432 </span></a><span class="s0">How could one be sure that it was simple trickery?</span>
<a name="l6433"><span class="ln">6433 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien was looking down at him speculatively.</span>
<a name="l6434"><span class="ln">6434 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyes flitted towards the dial.</span>
<a name="l6435"><span class="ln">6435 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien smiled faintly.</span>
<a name="l6436"><span class="ln">6436 </span></a><span class="s0">'You are no metaphysician, Winston,' he said.</span>
<a name="l6437"><span class="ln">6437 </span></a><span class="s0">I will put it more precisely.</span>
<a name="l6438"><span class="ln">6438 </span></a><span class="s0">Does the past exist concretely, in space?</span>
<a name="l6439"><span class="ln">6439 </span></a><span class="s0">It is written down.' 'In records.</span>
<a name="l6440"><span class="ln">6440 </span></a><span class="s0">And——?' 'In the mind.</span>
<a name="l6441"><span class="ln">6441 </span></a><span class="s0">In human memories.' 'In memory.</span>
<a name="l6442"><span class="ln">6442 </span></a><span class="s0">Very well, then.</span>
<a name="l6443"><span class="ln">6443 </span></a><span class="s0">'It is involuntary.</span>
<a name="l6444"><span class="ln">6444 </span></a><span class="s0">It is outside oneself.</span>
<a name="l6445"><span class="ln">6445 </span></a><span class="s0">How can you control memory?</span>
<a name="l6446"><span class="ln">6446 </span></a><span class="s0">You have not controlled mine!' O'Brien's manner grew stern again.</span>
<a name="l6447"><span class="ln">6447 </span></a><span class="s0">He laid his hand on the dial.</span>
<a name="l6448"><span class="ln">6448 </span></a><span class="s0">'On the contrary,' he said, 'YOU have not controlled it.</span>
<a name="l6449"><span class="ln">6449 </span></a><span class="s0">That is what has brought you here.</span>
<a name="l6450"><span class="ln">6450 </span></a><span class="s0">You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one.</span>
<a name="l6451"><span class="ln">6451 </span></a><span class="s0">Only the disciplined mind can see reality, Winston.</span>
<a name="l6452"><span class="ln">6452 </span></a><span class="s0">You also believe that the nature of reality is selfevident.</span>
<a name="l6453"><span class="ln">6453 </span></a><span class="s0">But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external.</span>
<a name="l6454"><span class="ln">6454 </span></a><span class="s0">Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else.</span>
<a name="l6455"><span class="ln">6455 </span></a><span class="s0">Whatever the Party holds to be the truth, is truth.</span>
<a name="l6456"><span class="ln">6456 </span></a><span class="s0">The needle of the dial had shot up to fifty-five.</span>
<a name="l6457"><span class="ln">6457 </span></a><span class="s0">The sweat had sprung out all over Winston's body.</span>
<a name="l6458"><span class="ln">6458 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien watched him, the four fingers still extended.</span>
<a name="l6459"><span class="ln">6459 </span></a><span class="s0">He drew back the lever.</span>
<a name="l6460"><span class="ln">6460 </span></a><span class="s0">This time the pain was only slightly eased.</span>
<a name="l6461"><span class="ln">6461 </span></a><span class="s0">'How many fingers, Winston?' 'Four!</span>
<a name="l6462"><span class="ln">6462 </span></a><span class="s0">What else can I say?</span>
<a name="l6463"><span class="ln">6463 </span></a><span class="s0">'How many fingers, Winston?' 316 1984 'Four!</span>
<a name="l6464"><span class="ln">6464 </span></a><span class="s0">Stop it, stop it!</span>
<a name="l6465"><span class="ln">6465 </span></a><span class="s0">How can you go on?</span>
<a name="l6466"><span class="ln">6466 </span></a><span class="s0">Four!' 'How many fingers, Winston?' 'Five!</span>
<a name="l6467"><span class="ln">6467 </span></a><span class="s0">Five!' 'No, Winston, that is no use.</span>
<a name="l6468"><span class="ln">6468 </span></a><span class="s0">You are lying.</span>
<a name="l6469"><span class="ln">6469 </span></a><span class="s0">You still think there are four.</span>
<a name="l6470"><span class="ln">6470 </span></a><span class="s0">How many fingers, please?' 'Four!</span>
<a name="l6471"><span class="ln">6471 </span></a><span class="s0">Anything you like.</span>
<a name="l6472"><span class="ln">6472 </span></a><span class="s0">He had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds.</span>
<a name="l6473"><span class="ln">6473 </span></a><span class="s0">The bonds that had held his body down were loosened.</span>
<a name="l6474"><span class="ln">6474 </span></a><span class="s0">'You are a slow learner, Winston,' said O'Brien gently.</span>
<a name="l6475"><span class="ln">6475 </span></a><span class="s0">'How can I help it?' he blubbered.</span>
<a name="l6476"><span class="ln">6476 </span></a><span class="s0">Two and two are four.' Sometimes, Winston.</span>
<a name="l6477"><span class="ln">6477 </span></a><span class="s0">Sometimes they are five.</span>
<a name="l6478"><span class="ln">6478 </span></a><span class="s0">Sometimes they are three.</span>
<a name="l6479"><span class="ln">6479 </span></a><span class="s0">Sometimes they are all of them at once.</span>
<a name="l6480"><span class="ln">6480 </span></a><span class="s0">You must try harder.</span>
<a name="l6481"><span class="ln">6481 </span></a><span class="s0">'Again,' said O'Brien.</span>
<a name="l6482"><span class="ln">6482 </span></a><span class="s0">The pain flowed into Winston's body.</span>
<a name="l6483"><span class="ln">6483 </span></a><span class="s0">The needle must be at seventy, seventy-five.</span>
<a name="l6484"><span class="ln">6484 </span></a><span class="s0">He had shut his eyes this time.</span>
<a name="l6485"><span class="ln">6485 </span></a><span class="s0">The pain lessened again.</span>
<a name="l6486"><span class="ln">6486 </span></a><span class="s0">He opened his eyes.</span>
<a name="l6487"><span class="ln">6487 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien had drawn back the lever.</span>
<a name="l6488"><span class="ln">6488 </span></a><span class="s0">'How many fingers, Winston?' 'Four.</span>
<a name="l6489"><span class="ln">6489 </span></a><span class="s0">I suppose there are four.</span>
<a name="l6490"><span class="ln">6490 </span></a><span class="s0">I would see five if I could.</span>
<a name="l6491"><span class="ln">6491 </span></a><span class="s0">Perhaps the needle was eighty—ninety.</span>
<a name="l6492"><span class="ln">6492 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston could not intermittently remember why the pain was happening.</span>
<a name="l6493"><span class="ln">6493 </span></a><span class="s0">The pain died down again.</span>
<a name="l6494"><span class="ln">6494 </span></a><span class="s0">He shut 318 1984 his eyes again.</span>
<a name="l6495"><span class="ln">6495 </span></a><span class="s0">I don't know.</span>
<a name="l6496"><span class="ln">6496 </span></a><span class="s0">You will kill me if you do that again.</span>
<a name="l6497"><span class="ln">6497 </span></a><span class="s0">A needle slid into Winston's arm.</span>
<a name="l6498"><span class="ln">6498 </span></a><span class="s0">The pain was already half-forgotten.</span>
<a name="l6499"><span class="ln">6499 </span></a><span class="s0">He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O'Brien.</span>
<a name="l6500"><span class="ln">6500 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien was a person who could be talked to.</span>
<a name="l6501"><span class="ln">6501 </span></a><span class="s0">It made no difference.</span>
<a name="l6502"><span class="ln">6502 </span></a><span class="s0">When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.</span>
<a name="l6503"><span class="ln">6503 </span></a><span class="s0">'Do you know where you are, Winston?' he said.</span>
<a name="l6504"><span class="ln">6504 </span></a><span class="s0">'I don't know.</span>
<a name="l6505"><span class="ln">6505 </span></a><span class="s0">I can guess.</span>
<a name="l6506"><span class="ln">6506 </span></a><span class="s0">Try again.' 'To punish them.' 'No!' exclaimed O'Brien.</span>
<a name="l6507"><span class="ln">6507 </span></a><span class="s0">Not merely to extract your confession, not to punish you.</span>
<a name="l6508"><span class="ln">6508 </span></a><span class="s0">Shall I tell you why we have brought you here?</span>
<a name="l6509"><span class="ln">6509 </span></a><span class="s0">To cure you!</span>
<a name="l6510"><span class="ln">6510 </span></a><span class="s0">To make you sane!</span>
<a name="l6511"><span class="ln">6511 </span></a><span class="s0">We do not merely destroy our enemies, we change them.</span>
<a name="l6512"><span class="ln">6512 </span></a><span class="s0">Again Winston's heart shrank.</span>
<a name="l6513"><span class="ln">6513 </span></a><span class="s0">At this moment, however, O'Brien turned away.</span>
<a name="l6514"><span class="ln">6514 </span></a><span class="s0">He took a pace or two up and down.</span>
<a name="l6515"><span class="ln">6515 </span></a><span class="s0">In the Middle Ages there was the Inquisitlon.</span>
<a name="l6516"><span class="ln">6516 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a failure.</span>
<a name="l6517"><span class="ln">6517 </span></a><span class="s0">Why was that?</span>
<a name="l6518"><span class="ln">6518 </span></a><span class="s0">There were the German Nazis and the Russian Communists.</span>
<a name="l6519"><span class="ln">6519 </span></a><span class="s0">Once again, why was it?</span>
<a name="l6520"><span class="ln">6520 </span></a><span class="s0">We do not make mistakes of that kind.</span>
<a name="l6521"><span class="ln">6521 </span></a><span class="s0">All the confessions that are uttered here are true.</span>
<a name="l6522"><span class="ln">6522 </span></a><span class="s0">We make them true.</span>
<a name="l6523"><span class="ln">6523 </span></a><span class="s0">Posterity will never hear of you.</span>
<a name="l6524"><span class="ln">6524 </span></a><span class="s0">thought Winston, with a momentary bitterness.</span>
<a name="l6525"><span class="ln">6525 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien smiled slightly.</span>
<a name="l6526"><span class="ln">6526 </span></a><span class="s0">'You are a flaw in the pattern, Winston.</span>
<a name="l6527"><span class="ln">6527 </span></a><span class="s0">You are a stain that must be wiped out.</span>
<a name="l6528"><span class="ln">6528 </span></a><span class="s0">We make him one of ourselves before we kill him.</span>
<a name="l6529"><span class="ln">6529 </span></a><span class="s0">The command of the old despotisms was 'Thou shalt not”.</span>
<a name="l6530"><span class="ln">6530 </span></a><span class="s0">The command of the totalitarians was 'Thou shalt”.</span>
<a name="l6531"><span class="ln">6531 </span></a><span class="s0">Our command is 'THOU ART”.</span>

<a name="l6533"><span class="ln">6533 </span></a><span class="s0">I took part in their interrogation myself.</span>
<a name="l6534"><span class="ln">6534 </span></a><span class="s0">It was touching to see how they loved him.</span>
<a name="l6535"><span class="ln">6535 </span></a><span class="s0">The exaltation, the lunatic enthusiasm, was still in his face.</span>
<a name="l6536"><span class="ln">6536 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien was a being in all ways larger than himself.</span>
<a name="l6537"><span class="ln">6537 </span></a><span class="s0">His mind CONTAINED Winston's mind.</span>
<a name="l6538"><span class="ln">6538 </span></a><span class="s0">It must be he, Winston, who was mad.</span>
<a name="l6539"><span class="ln">6539 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien halted and looked down at him.</span>
<a name="l6540"><span class="ln">6540 </span></a><span class="s0">His voice had grown stern again.</span>
<a name="l6541"><span class="ln">6541 </span></a><span class="s0">No one who has once gone astray is ever spared.</span>
<a name="l6542"><span class="ln">6542 </span></a><span class="s0">What happens to you here is for ever.</span>
<a name="l6543"><span class="ln">6543 </span></a><span class="s0">Understand that in advance.</span>
<a name="l6544"><span class="ln">6544 </span></a><span class="s0">Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling.</span>
<a name="l6545"><span class="ln">6545 </span></a><span class="s0">Everything will be dead inside you.</span>
<a name="l6546"><span class="ln">6546 </span></a><span class="s0">You will be hollow.</span>
<a name="l6547"><span class="ln">6547 </span></a><span class="s0">There was pain coming, a new kind of pain.</span>
<a name="l6548"><span class="ln">6548 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien laid a hand reassuringly, almost kindly, on his.</span>
<a name="l6549"><span class="ln">6549 </span></a><span class="s0">'This time it will not hurt,' he said.</span>
<a name="l6550"><span class="ln">6550 </span></a><span class="s0">There was undoubtedly a blinding flash of light.</span>
<a name="l6551"><span class="ln">6551 </span></a><span class="s0">Winston was not hurt, only prostrated.</span>
<a name="l6552"><span class="ln">6552 </span></a><span class="s0">A terrific painless blow had flattened him out.</span>
<a name="l6553"><span class="ln">6553 </span></a><span class="s0">Also something had happened inside his head.</span>
<a name="l6554"><span class="ln">6554 </span></a><span class="s0">'It will not last,' said O'Brien.</span>
<a name="l6555"><span class="ln">6555 </span></a><span class="s0">'Look me in the eyes.</span>
<a name="l6556"><span class="ln">6556 </span></a><span class="s0">What country is Oceania at war with?' Winston thought.</span>
<a name="l6557"><span class="ln">6557 </span></a><span class="s0">'I don't remember.' 'Oceania is at war with Eastasia.</span>
<a name="l6558"><span class="ln">6558 </span></a><span class="s0">No such piece of paper ever existed.</span>
<a name="l6559"><span class="ln">6559 </span></a><span class="s0">You saw five fingers.</span>
<a name="l6560"><span class="ln">6560 </span></a><span class="s0">'There are five fingers there.</span>
<a name="l6561"><span class="ln">6561 </span></a><span class="s0">He saw five fingers, and there was no deformity.</span>
<a name="l6562"><span class="ln">6562 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien stood up with a satisfied air.</span>
<a name="l6563"><span class="ln">6563 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien turned to Winston with a smile.</span>
<a name="l6564"><span class="ln">6564 </span></a><span class="s0">You were right.</span>
<a name="l6565"><span class="ln">6565 </span></a><span class="s0">I enjoy talking to you.</span>
<a name="l6566"><span class="ln">6566 </span></a><span class="s0">Your mind appeals to me.</span>
<a name="l6567"><span class="ln">6567 </span></a><span class="s0">'It is switched off.</span>
<a name="l6568"><span class="ln">6568 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien smiled again.</span>
<a name="l6569"><span class="ln">6569 </span></a><span class="s0">'She betrayed you, Winston.</span>
<a name="l6570"><span class="ln">6570 </span></a><span class="s0">You would hardly recognize her if you saw her.</span>
<a name="l6571"><span class="ln">6571 </span></a><span class="s0">'Next question,' he said.</span>
<a name="l6572"><span class="ln">6572 </span></a><span class="s0">'Does Big Brother exist?' 'Of course he exists.</span>
<a name="l6573"><span class="ln">6573 </span></a><span class="s0">The Party exists.</span>
<a name="l6574"><span class="ln">6574 </span></a><span class="s0">Once again the sense of helplessness assailed him.</span>
<a name="l6575"><span class="ln">6575 </span></a><span class="s0">But what use was it to say so?</span>
<a name="l6576"><span class="ln">6576 </span></a><span class="s0">'I think I exist,' he said wearily.</span>
<a name="l6577"><span class="ln">6577 </span></a><span class="s0">'I am conscious of my own identity.</span>
<a name="l6578"><span class="ln">6578 </span></a><span class="s0">I was born and I shall die.</span>
<a name="l6579"><span class="ln">6579 </span></a><span class="s0">I have arms and legs.</span>
<a name="l6580"><span class="ln">6580 </span></a><span class="s0">I occupy a particular point in space.</span>
<a name="l6581"><span class="ln">6581 </span></a><span class="s0">No other solid object can occupy the same point simultaneously.</span>
<a name="l6582"><span class="ln">6582 </span></a><span class="s0">He exists.' 'Will Big Brother ever die?' 'Of course not.</span>
<a name="l6583"><span class="ln">6583 </span></a><span class="s0">How could he die?</span>
<a name="l6584"><span class="ln">6584 </span></a><span class="s0">His breast rose and fell a little faster.</span>
<a name="l6585"><span class="ln">6585 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a trace of amusement in O'Brien's face.</span>
<a name="l6586"><span class="ln">6586 </span></a><span class="s0">Even his spectacles seemed to wear an ironical gleam.</span>
<a name="l6587"><span class="ln">6587 </span></a><span class="s0">Evidently the session was at an end.</span>
<a name="l6588"><span class="ln">6588 </span></a><span class="s0">A needle jerked into Winston's arm.</span>
<a name="l6589"><span class="ln">6589 </span></a><span class="s0">He sank almost instantly into deep sleep.</span>
<a name="l6590"><span class="ln">6590 </span></a><span class="s0">'There is learning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance.</span>
<a name="l6591"><span class="ln">6591 </span></a><span class="s0">But of late his bonds were looser.</span>
<a name="l6592"><span class="ln">6592 </span></a><span class="s0">He could not remember how many sessions there had been.</span>
<a name="l6593"><span class="ln">6593 </span></a><span class="s0">'I wrote it.</span>
<a name="l6594"><span class="ln">6594 </span></a><span class="s0">That is to say, I collaborated in writing it.</span>
<a name="l6595"><span class="ln">6595 </span></a><span class="s0">The programme it sets forth is nonsense.</span>
<a name="l6596"><span class="ln">6596 </span></a><span class="s0">You foresaw yourself that that was what it would say.</span>
<a name="l6597"><span class="ln">6597 </span></a><span class="s0">It is all nonsense.</span>
<a name="l6598"><span class="ln">6598 </span></a><span class="s0">The rule of the Party is for ever.</span>
<a name="l6599"><span class="ln">6599 </span></a><span class="s0">'For ever!' he repeated.</span>
<a name="l6600"><span class="ln">6600 </span></a><span class="s0">Now tell me WHY we cling to power.</span>
<a name="l6601"><span class="ln">6601 </span></a><span class="s0">What is our motive?</span>
<a name="l6602"><span class="ln">6602 </span></a><span class="s0">Why should we want power?</span>
<a name="l6603"><span class="ln">6603 </span></a><span class="s0">Go on, speak,' he added as Winston remained silent.</span>
<a name="l6604"><span class="ln">6604 </span></a><span class="s0">Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or two.</span>
<a name="l6605"><span class="ln">6605 </span></a><span class="s0">A feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him.</span>
<a name="l6606"><span class="ln">6606 </span></a><span class="s0">He knew in advance what O'Brien would say.</span>
<a name="l6607"><span class="ln">6607 </span></a><span class="s0">You could see it in his face.</span>
<a name="l6608"><span class="ln">6608 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien knew everything.</span>
<a name="l6609"><span class="ln">6609 </span></a><span class="s0">A pang of pain had shot through his body.</span>
<a name="l6610"><span class="ln">6610 </span></a><span class="s0">'That was stupid, Winston, stupid!' he said.</span>
<a name="l6611"><span class="ln">6611 </span></a><span class="s0">It is this.</span>
<a name="l6612"><span class="ln">6612 </span></a><span class="s0">The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake.</span>
<a name="l6613"><span class="ln">6613 </span></a><span class="s0">What pure power means you will understand presently.</span>
<a name="l6614"><span class="ln">6614 </span></a><span class="s0">We are not like that.</span>
<a name="l6615"><span class="ln">6615 </span></a><span class="s0">Power is not a means, it is an end.</span>
<a name="l6616"><span class="ln">6616 </span></a><span class="s0">The object of persecution is persecution.</span>
<a name="l6617"><span class="ln">6617 </span></a><span class="s0">The object of torture is torture.</span>
<a name="l6618"><span class="ln">6618 </span></a><span class="s0">The object of power is power.</span>
<a name="l6619"><span class="ln">6619 </span></a><span class="s0">O'Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing the worn face nearer.</span>
<a name="l6620"><span class="ln">6620 </span></a><span class="s0">'We are the priests of power,' he said.</span>
<a name="l6621"><span class="ln">6621 </span></a><span class="s0">'God is power.</span>
<a name="l6622"><span class="ln">6622 </span></a><span class="s0">You know the Party slogan: 'Freedom is Slavery”.</span>
<a name="l6623"><span class="ln">6623 </span></a><span class="s0">Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible?</span>
<a name="l6624"><span class="ln">6624 </span></a><span class="s0">Slavery is freedom.</span>
<a name="l6625"><span class="ln">6625 </span></a><span class="s0">Alone—free—the human being is always defeated.</span>

<a name="l6627"><span class="ln">6627 </span></a><span class="s0">'But how can you control matter?' he burst out.</span>
<a name="l6628"><span class="ln">6628 </span></a><span class="s0">'We control matter because we control the mind.</span>
<a name="l6629"><span class="ln">6629 </span></a><span class="s0">Reality is inside the skull.</span>
<a name="l6630"><span class="ln">6630 </span></a><span class="s0">You will learn by degrees, Winston.</span>
<a name="l6631"><span class="ln">6631 </span></a><span class="s0">There is nothing that we could not do.</span>
<a name="l6632"><span class="ln">6632 </span></a><span class="s0">We make the laws of Nature.' 'But you do not!</span>
<a name="l6633"><span class="ln">6633 </span></a><span class="s0">You are not even masters of this planet.</span>
<a name="l6634"><span class="ln">6634 </span></a><span class="s0">What about Eurasia and Eastasia?</span>
<a name="l6635"><span class="ln">6635 </span></a><span class="s0">You have not conquered them yet.' 'Unimportant.</span>

<a name="l6637"><span class="ln">6637 </span></a><span class="s0">And if we did not, what difference would it make?</span>
<a name="l6638"><span class="ln">6638 </span></a><span class="s0">We can shut them out of existence.</span>
<a name="l6639"><span class="ln">6639 </span></a><span class="s0">And man is tiny—helpless!</span>
<a name="l6640"><span class="ln">6640 </span></a><span class="s0">How long has he been in existence?</span>
<a name="l6641"><span class="ln">6641 </span></a><span class="s0">For millions of years the earth was uninhabited.' 'Nonsense.</span>
<a name="l6642"><span class="ln">6642 </span></a><span class="s0">The earth is as old as we are, no older.</span>
<a name="l6643"><span class="ln">6643 </span></a><span class="s0">How could it be older?</span>
<a name="l6644"><span class="ln">6644 </span></a><span class="s0">Of course not.</span>

<a name="l6648"><span class="ln">6648 </span></a><span class="s0">Some of them are a million light-years away.</span>
<a name="l6649"><span class="ln">6649 </span></a><span class="s0">'They are bits of fire a few kilometres away.</span>
<a name="l6650"><span class="ln">6650 </span></a><span class="s0">We could reach them if we wanted to.</span>

<a name="l6653"><span class="ln">6653 </span></a><span class="s0">This time he did not say anything.</span>
<a name="l6654"><span class="ln">6654 </span></a><span class="s0">But what of it?</span>
<a name="l6655"><span class="ln">6655 </span></a><span class="s0">Do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that?</span>
<a name="l6656"><span class="ln">6656 </span></a><span class="s0">Have you forgotten doublethink?' Winston shrank back upon the bed.</span>
<a name="l6657"><span class="ln">6657 </span></a><span class="s0">Had it not been exposed long ago as a fallacy?</span>
<a name="l6658"><span class="ln">6658 </span></a><span class="s0">But you are mistaken.</span>

<a name="l6722"><span class="ln">6722 </span></a><span class="s0">We.’ Sam opens his mouth to argue, but why bother?</span>
<a name="l6723"><span class="ln">6723 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s never said no to him in his life.</span>
<a name="l6724"><span class="ln">6724 </span></a><span class="s0">Plus he’s not wrong about how loud they’re being.</span>
<a name="l6725"><span class="ln">6725 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s truly lost it this evening.</span>
<a name="l6726"><span class="ln">6726 </span></a><span class="s0">Not that it’s an untrue feeling.</span>
<a name="l6727"><span class="ln">6727 </span></a><span class="s0">Not when he has blood on his knuckles.</span>
<a name="l6728"><span class="ln">6728 </span></a><span class="s0">He suddenly feels very tired.</span>
<a name="l6729"><span class="ln">6729 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s just this.</span>

<a name="l6731"><span class="ln">6731 </span></a><span class="s0">And don’t – don’t break anything.</span>
<a name="l6732"><span class="ln">6732 </span></a><span class="s0">I want to stay here for a few days.</span>
<a name="l6733"><span class="ln">6733 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam smothers his annoyance.</span>
<a name="l6734"><span class="ln">6734 </span></a><span class="s0">He keeps them for emergencies.</span>
<a name="l6735"><span class="ln">6735 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers shake.</span>
<a name="l6736"><span class="ln">6736 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Are you screwing up?’ Avery says in a conversational tone.</span>
<a name="l6737"><span class="ln">6737 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam stabs harder at the lock.</span>
<a name="l6738"><span class="ln">6738 </span></a><span class="s0">But a night alone would be a quiet break.</span>
<a name="l6739"><span class="ln">6739 </span></a><span class="s0">This is your brother.</span>
<a name="l6740"><span class="ln">6740 </span></a><span class="s0">You don’t need a break.</span>
<a name="l6741"><span class="ln">6741 </span></a><span class="s0">You shouldn’t want one.</span>

<a name="l6743"><span class="ln">6743 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sure,’ Sam says, knowing Avery won’t notice the sarcasm.</span>
<a name="l6744"><span class="ln">6744 </span></a><span class="s0">They let him sleep on their broken sofa.</span>
<a name="l6745"><span class="ln">6745 </span></a><span class="s0">And that sameness?</span>
<a name="l6746"><span class="ln">6746 </span></a><span class="s0">Only having to rotate between two places that don’t change?</span>
<a name="l6747"><span class="ln">6747 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s why Sam’s bloody and bruised tonight, isn’t it?</span>

<a name="l6749"><span class="ln">6749 </span></a><span class="s0">So, simple: he doesn’t get to know.</span>
<a name="l6750"><span class="ln">6750 </span></a><span class="s0">How much it scares him.</span>
<a name="l6751"><span class="ln">6751 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery chews his lip.</span>
<a name="l6752"><span class="ln">6752 </span></a><span class="s0">Now to wash off the blood.</span>
<a name="l6753"><span class="ln">6753 </span></a><span class="s0">Now to curl up in a soft chair.</span>

<a name="l6765"><span class="ln">6765 </span></a><span class="s0">He finds a flight itinerary in the rubbish.</span>
<a name="l6766"><span class="ln">6766 </span></a><span class="s0">He could have a week in this house.</span>

<a name="l6772"><span class="ln">6772 </span></a><span class="s0">He didn’t always rob the houses.</span>

<a name="l6774"><span class="ln">6774 </span></a><span class="s0">Pretended he could keep this.</span>
<a name="l6775"><span class="ln">6775 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he started taking keys.</span>
<a name="l6776"><span class="ln">6776 </span></a><span class="s0">To remember each house by.</span>
<a name="l6777"><span class="ln">6777 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he started taking money.</span>

<a name="l6781"><span class="ln">6781 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam just fixed Avery’s last screw-up.</span>

<a name="l6783"><span class="ln">6783 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re his) but Avery appears from behind the pantry door.</span>
<a name="l6784"><span class="ln">6784 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What the hell,’ he says, ‘are seaweed crackers?’ Sam sighs.</span>
<a name="l6785"><span class="ln">6785 </span></a><span class="s0">‘These are diseased.</span>
<a name="l6786"><span class="ln">6786 </span></a><span class="s0">Anyway, I want to—’ He looks up.</span>
<a name="l6787"><span class="ln">6787 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Leave it.’ His voice stays low.</span>
<a name="l6788"><span class="ln">6788 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery doesn’t notice Sam’s tone, he hardly ever does.</span>
<a name="l6789"><span class="ln">6789 </span></a><span class="s0">His legs swing, pace growing frantic.</span>
<a name="l6790"><span class="ln">6790 </span></a><span class="s0">Those are the rules.’ Crackers crunch.</span>
<a name="l6791"><span class="ln">6791 </span></a><span class="s0">Heels drum on the bench.</span>
<a name="l6792"><span class="ln">6792 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I guess we both broke the rules,’ Sam says quietly.</span>
<a name="l6793"><span class="ln">6793 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s eyes widen.</span>
<a name="l6794"><span class="ln">6794 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But I—’ ‘Save it.</span>
<a name="l6795"><span class="ln">6795 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery snaps his fingers by his ears and doesn’t answer.</span>
<a name="l6796"><span class="ln">6796 </span></a><span class="s0">This is all so unfair.</span>
<a name="l6797"><span class="ln">6797 </span></a><span class="s0">He’d need him.</span>
<a name="l6798"><span class="ln">6798 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery would have a chance to redeem himself.</span>
<a name="l6799"><span class="ln">6799 </span></a><span class="s0">The guy was big, but Sam’s good at fighting.</span>
<a name="l6800"><span class="ln">6800 </span></a><span class="s0">It scares Avery, the way Sam hits.</span>
<a name="l6801"><span class="ln">6801 </span></a><span class="s0">It scares Sam too.</span>
<a name="l6802"><span class="ln">6802 </span></a><span class="s0">But what’s he supposed to do?</span>
<a name="l6803"><span class="ln">6803 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s got nothing else.</span>
<a name="l6804"><span class="ln">6804 </span></a><span class="s0">‘In a stolen car?</span>

<a name="l6807"><span class="ln">6807 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Our plan sucks.’ Avery rocks on the bench.</span>
<a name="l6808"><span class="ln">6808 </span></a><span class="s0">Let’s just drive away.</span>
<a name="l6809"><span class="ln">6809 </span></a><span class="s0">Doesn’t he know Sam at all?</span>
<a name="l6810"><span class="ln">6810 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam looks down at his hands, fisted and trembling.</span>
<a name="l6811"><span class="ln">6811 </span></a><span class="s0">And you’re a wanted criminal.</span>
<a name="l6812"><span class="ln">6812 </span></a><span class="s0">We’re going to live in our own house.</span>
<a name="l6813"><span class="ln">6813 </span></a><span class="s0">We’re going to be OK.</span>
<a name="l6814"><span class="ln">6814 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No.’ But there are too many cracks in Sam’s voice.</span>
<a name="l6815"><span class="ln">6815 </span></a><span class="s0">How unrealistic his wishes are.</span>
<a name="l6816"><span class="ln">6816 </span></a><span class="s0">How naive he’s being.</span>
<a name="l6817"><span class="ln">6817 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s voice grows shrill.</span>
<a name="l6818"><span class="ln">6818 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But if we stay the police will catch you!</span>
<a name="l6819"><span class="ln">6819 </span></a><span class="s0">I can’t let them catch you.</span>
<a name="l6820"><span class="ln">6820 </span></a><span class="s0">It splinters against the tiles like a gunshot.</span>
<a name="l6821"><span class="ln">6821 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone’s going to hear.</span>
<a name="l6822"><span class="ln">6822 </span></a><span class="s0">This is Avery.</span>

<a name="l6825"><span class="ln">6825 </span></a><span class="s0">I don’t care.</span>
<a name="l6826"><span class="ln">6826 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t say that.’ Sam’s voice is barely a whisper.</span>
<a name="l6827"><span class="ln">6827 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll leave you.’ Don’t ever, ever say that.</span>
<a name="l6828"><span class="ln">6828 </span></a><span class="s0">He slams the door on his way out.</span>
<a name="l6829"><span class="ln">6829 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam doesn’t understand.</span>
<a name="l6830"><span class="ln">6830 </span></a><span class="s0">But he can’t stay here now.</span>
<a name="l6831"><span class="ln">6831 </span></a><span class="s0">He should run after Avery.</span>
<a name="l6832"><span class="ln">6832 </span></a><span class="s0">He didn’t mean it, right?</span>
<a name="l6833"><span class="ln">6833 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re all each other has.</span>
<a name="l6834"><span class="ln">6834 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s the only who sees Sammy Lou, the forgotten boy.</span>
<a name="l6835"><span class="ln">6835 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll leave you.</span>
<a name="l6836"><span class="ln">6836 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam doesn’t take anything on his way out.</span>
<a name="l6837"><span class="ln">6837 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s his secret failure.</span>
<a name="l6838"><span class="ln">6838 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t break into houses because he enjoys stealing.</span>
<a name="l6839"><span class="ln">6839 </span></a><span class="s0">No, let’s have a winter rerun.</span>
<a name="l6840"><span class="ln">6840 </span></a><span class="s0">Won’t that be fun?</span>
<a name="l6841"><span class="ln">6841 </span></a><span class="s0">It keeps most of the rain off.</span>
<a name="l6842"><span class="ln">6842 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery will go back to his shifty friends’ house.</span>
<a name="l6843"><span class="ln">6843 </span></a><span class="s0">No, no he will.</span>
<a name="l6844"><span class="ln">6844 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a stupid threat.</span>
<a name="l6845"><span class="ln">6845 </span></a><span class="s0">He could never just go.</span>
<a name="l6846"><span class="ln">6846 </span></a><span class="s0">It’ll be a nice day – Saturday, right?</span>
<a name="l6847"><span class="ln">6847 </span></a><span class="s0">At least that’s what he pretends normal people do.</span>
<a name="l6848"><span class="ln">6848 </span></a><span class="s0">His thoughts spin, dizzying.</span>
<a name="l6849"><span class="ln">6849 </span></a><span class="s0">He feels genuinely ill right now.</span>
<a name="l6850"><span class="ln">6850 </span></a><span class="s0">His nose won’t stop running.</span>
<a name="l6851"><span class="ln">6851 </span></a><span class="s0">She might be in a good mood.</span>
<a name="l6852"><span class="ln">6852 </span></a><span class="s0">Or she’ll call the police.</span>
<a name="l6853"><span class="ln">6853 </span></a><span class="s0">Who is he kidding?</span>
<a name="l6854"><span class="ln">6854 </span></a><span class="s0">This is Aunt Karen.</span>
<a name="l6855"><span class="ln">6855 </span></a><span class="s0">If she sees him, she’ll go straight to the phone.</span>
<a name="l6856"><span class="ln">6856 </span></a><span class="s0">Stealing houses is an art.</span>
<a name="l6857"><span class="ln">6857 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs to get off the streets and lie down.</span>
<a name="l6858"><span class="ln">6858 </span></a><span class="s0">He tries two houses.</span>
<a name="l6859"><span class="ln">6859 </span></a><span class="s0">The second house is definitely a victim of longer-term abandonment.</span>
<a name="l6860"><span class="ln">6860 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t risk staying here.</span>
<a name="l6861"><span class="ln">6861 </span></a><span class="s0">He could find a payphone and call Avery.</span>
<a name="l6862"><span class="ln">6862 </span></a><span class="s0">At least his clothes dry in the warm midday sun.</span>
<a name="l6863"><span class="ln">6863 </span></a><span class="s0">Wow, he’s so healthy.</span>
<a name="l6864"><span class="ln">6864 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam checks the street.</span>
<a name="l6865"><span class="ln">6865 </span></a><span class="s0">He listens at the doors but it’s silent.</span>
<a name="l6866"><span class="ln">6866 </span></a><span class="s0">Please be empty, please please please.</span>
<a name="l6867"><span class="ln">6867 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s an open-plan room, with support poles instead of walls.</span>
<a name="l6868"><span class="ln">6868 </span></a><span class="s0">Check for fresh food?</span>
<a name="l6869"><span class="ln">6869 </span></a><span class="s0">Still … that’s promising.</span>
<a name="l6870"><span class="ln">6870 </span></a><span class="s0">Another sign that the occupants are away.</span>
<a name="l6871"><span class="ln">6871 </span></a><span class="s0">Back on Sunday.</span>
<a name="l6872"><span class="ln">6872 </span></a><span class="s0">The house is his.</span>
<a name="l6873"><span class="ln">6873 </span></a><span class="s0">Take that, you freaking streaming nose.</span>
<a name="l6874"><span class="ln">6874 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s favourite type of house.</span>
<a name="l6875"><span class="ln">6875 </span></a><span class="s0">By the way, Sam, you are a freak.</span>
<a name="l6876"><span class="ln">6876 </span></a><span class="s0">He feels feverishly warm.</span>
<a name="l6877"><span class="ln">6877 </span></a><span class="s0">OK, so these people don’t believe in cupboards.</span>
<a name="l6878"><span class="ln">6878 </span></a><span class="s0">They believe in obstacle courses.</span>
<a name="l6879"><span class="ln">6879 </span></a><span class="s0">He has a new appreciation for only having one brother.</span>
<a name="l6880"><span class="ln">6880 </span></a><span class="s0">Imagine a dozen Averys?</span>
<a name="l6881"><span class="ln">6881 </span></a><span class="s0">No thank you.</span>
<a name="l6882"><span class="ln">6882 </span></a><span class="s0">He is so very, very tired.</span>
<a name="l6883"><span class="ln">6883 </span></a><span class="s0">Side effects probably … definitely … include … drowsiness.</span>
<a name="l6884"><span class="ln">6884 </span></a><span class="s0">The sun is so warm on his cheek.</span>
<a name="l6885"><span class="ln">6885 </span></a><span class="s0">But if Sammy complains he’ll just get another slap.</span>
<a name="l6886"><span class="ln">6886 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery hums softly to himself in the seat beside Sammy.</span>
<a name="l6887"><span class="ln">6887 </span></a><span class="s0">He knows Avery’s just sharing, but Sammy’s hungry.</span>
<a name="l6888"><span class="ln">6888 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he goes still.</span>
<a name="l6889"><span class="ln">6889 </span></a><span class="s0">Scared of a slap.</span>
<a name="l6890"><span class="ln">6890 </span></a><span class="s0">Scared, even more, that Avery will get it.</span>
<a name="l6891"><span class="ln">6891 </span></a><span class="s0">He should’ve stayed quiet.</span>
<a name="l6892"><span class="ln">6892 </span></a><span class="s0">People stream out and in, wearing silly dresses.</span>
<a name="l6893"><span class="ln">6893 </span></a><span class="s0">They must be cold.</span>
<a name="l6894"><span class="ln">6894 </span></a><span class="s0">He reaches back and snatches the toy off Avery.</span>
<a name="l6895"><span class="ln">6895 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery gives a surprised yelp.</span>
<a name="l6896"><span class="ln">6896 </span></a><span class="s0">A sick hole gnaws at Sam’s stomach.</span>
<a name="l6897"><span class="ln">6897 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Grow up, Avery,’ their dad snaps.</span>
<a name="l6898"><span class="ln">6898 </span></a><span class="s0">His voice is a warning growl.</span>
<a name="l6899"><span class="ln">6899 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll be a few minutes.</span>
<a name="l6900"><span class="ln">6900 </span></a><span class="s0">Sit here while I pick something up.</span>
<a name="l6901"><span class="ln">6901 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy glances sideways at Avery.</span>
<a name="l6902"><span class="ln">6902 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs his car.</span>
<a name="l6903"><span class="ln">6903 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s his special car.</span>
<a name="l6904"><span class="ln">6904 </span></a><span class="s0">He always has it.</span>
<a name="l6905"><span class="ln">6905 </span></a><span class="s0">Fix this, Sammy.</span>
<a name="l6906"><span class="ln">6906 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He’ll give it back,’ says Sammy.</span>

<a name="l6909"><span class="ln">6909 </span></a><span class="s0">His dad has been angry ever since.</span>
<a name="l6910"><span class="ln">6910 </span></a><span class="s0">Well, he’s always angry.</span>
<a name="l6911"><span class="ln">6911 </span></a><span class="s0">This is not good.</span>
<a name="l6912"><span class="ln">6912 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t move.</span>
<a name="l6913"><span class="ln">6913 </span></a><span class="s0">He hates loud things.</span>
<a name="l6914"><span class="ln">6914 </span></a><span class="s0">Why’s he going in there?</span>
<a name="l6915"><span class="ln">6915 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t need his car that much, does he?</span>
<a name="l6916"><span class="ln">6916 </span></a><span class="s0">He sits there, handfuls of wild butterflies in his belly.</span>
<a name="l6917"><span class="ln">6917 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery never figures anything out.</span>
<a name="l6918"><span class="ln">6918 </span></a><span class="s0">But maybe it’ll be OK?</span>
<a name="l6919"><span class="ln">6919 </span></a><span class="s0">Are they all laughing?</span>
<a name="l6920"><span class="ln">6920 </span></a><span class="s0">You have to hold him.</span>
<a name="l6921"><span class="ln">6921 </span></a><span class="s0">You have to take him away till he calms down.</span>
<a name="l6922"><span class="ln">6922 </span></a><span class="s0">Even Sammy knows this and he’s only seven.</span>
<a name="l6923"><span class="ln">6923 </span></a><span class="s0">Hard to do because Avery writhes and kicks.</span>
<a name="l6924"><span class="ln">6924 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy holds his breath.</span>
<a name="l6925"><span class="ln">6925 </span></a><span class="s0">It’ll fix everything.</span>
<a name="l6926"><span class="ln">6926 </span></a><span class="s0">It doesn’t matter if Avery’s too old.</span>
<a name="l6927"><span class="ln">6927 </span></a><span class="s0">It makes him feel better.</span>
<a name="l6928"><span class="ln">6928 </span></a><span class="s0">And he hits him.</span>
<a name="l6929"><span class="ln">6929 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s screams turn to sobs.</span>
<a name="l6930"><span class="ln">6930 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy fights with his seatbelt now.</span>
<a name="l6931"><span class="ln">6931 </span></a><span class="s0">No one to hear over the thunder of the club.</span>
<a name="l6932"><span class="ln">6932 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s beaten his knuckles bloody on the window.</span>
<a name="l6933"><span class="ln">6933 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy can’t breathe.</span>
<a name="l6934"><span class="ln">6934 </span></a><span class="s0">He is red fire and he is burning.</span>
<a name="l6935"><span class="ln">6935 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re not allowed to hit Avery like that.</span>
<a name="l6936"><span class="ln">6936 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re not allowed.</span>
<a name="l6937"><span class="ln">6937 </span></a><span class="s0">He stretches shivering fingers to his brother.</span>
<a name="l6938"><span class="ln">6938 </span></a><span class="s0">His brother who is finally still and quiet.</span>
<a name="l6939"><span class="ln">6939 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s being good.</span>
<a name="l6940"><span class="ln">6940 </span></a><span class="s0">He wriggles free and crawls across the seat to Avery.</span>
<a name="l6941"><span class="ln">6941 </span></a><span class="s0">But his eyes find the rearview mirror and meet Sammy’s.</span>
<a name="l6942"><span class="ln">6942 </span></a><span class="s0">His dad’s eyes are furious.</span>
<a name="l6943"><span class="ln">6943 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy hates him.</span>
<a name="l6944"><span class="ln">6944 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy, strong and fierce, crouches over his brother.</span>
<a name="l6945"><span class="ln">6945 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s OK,’ Sammy whispers.</span>
<a name="l6946"><span class="ln">6946 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s voice is trembly but fierce.</span>
<a name="l6947"><span class="ln">6947 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll kill them.’ Deep in the house, Avery is shouting.</span>
<a name="l6948"><span class="ln">6948 </span></a><span class="s0">But he hasn’t slept this well in a long time.</span>
<a name="l6949"><span class="ln">6949 </span></a><span class="s0">Probably because he drugged himself.</span>
<a name="l6950"><span class="ln">6950 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam frowns in his sleep.</span>
<a name="l6951"><span class="ln">6951 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s in an empty house.</span>
<a name="l6952"><span class="ln">6952 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s not … empty.</span>
<a name="l6953"><span class="ln">6953 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s in a house that’s not empty.</span>
<a name="l6954"><span class="ln">6954 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not even sure what time it is.</span>
<a name="l6955"><span class="ln">6955 </span></a><span class="s0">Did he sleep all night?</span>
<a name="l6956"><span class="ln">6956 </span></a><span class="s0">He scrabbles off the armchair and over to the desk.</span>
<a name="l6957"><span class="ln">6957 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s slept for a whole day.</span>
<a name="l6958"><span class="ln">6958 </span></a><span class="s0">This can’t be happening.</span>
<a name="l6959"><span class="ln">6959 </span></a><span class="s0">Not hearing Avery sneak up on him is one thing.</span>
<a name="l6960"><span class="ln">6960 </span></a><span class="s0">But sleeping through a family returning?</span>
<a name="l6961"><span class="ln">6961 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s losing his touch.</span>
<a name="l6962"><span class="ln">6962 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s losing his mind.</span>
<a name="l6963"><span class="ln">6963 </span></a><span class="s0">They haven’t come in here yet, so that’s good.</span>
<a name="l6964"><span class="ln">6964 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing is good.</span>
<a name="l6965"><span class="ln">6965 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s in a house full of people.</span>
<a name="l6966"><span class="ln">6966 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t get out.</span>
<a name="l6967"><span class="ln">6967 </span></a><span class="s0">‘DAD!’ a girl’s voice hollers right outside the office door.</span>
<a name="l6968"><span class="ln">6968 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Which one?’ someone else yells, softer and distant.</span>
<a name="l6969"><span class="ln">6969 </span></a><span class="s0">Hands scrabbling for a phone.</span>
<a name="l6970"><span class="ln">6970 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to hide.</span>
<a name="l6971"><span class="ln">6971 </span></a><span class="s0">Then the door opens and he forgets how to breathe.</span>
<a name="l6972"><span class="ln">6972 </span></a><span class="s0">A girl storms in.</span>
<a name="l6973"><span class="ln">6973 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s knees are at his throat.</span>
<a name="l6974"><span class="ln">6974 </span></a><span class="s0">His heart punches new bruises into his ribs.</span>
<a name="l6975"><span class="ln">6975 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re such an idiot, Sammy Lou.</span>
<a name="l6976"><span class="ln">6976 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam stuffs knuckles into his mouth and bites.</span>
<a name="l6977"><span class="ln">6977 </span></a><span class="s0">Just hold on, just wait.</span>
<a name="l6978"><span class="ln">6978 </span></a><span class="s0">And, pathetically, it’s special to him.</span>
<a name="l6979"><span class="ln">6979 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s the only thing he owns.</span>
<a name="l6980"><span class="ln">6980 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ugh, Jack,’ she mutters, and steps over it.</span>
<a name="l6981"><span class="ln">6981 </span></a><span class="s0">She steps over it!</span>
<a name="l6982"><span class="ln">6982 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam remembers oxygen.</span>
<a name="l6983"><span class="ln">6983 </span></a><span class="s0">And in this mess, that’s probably likely.</span>
<a name="l6984"><span class="ln">6984 </span></a><span class="s0">Whoever ‘Jack’ is, he can happily take the blame.</span>
<a name="l6985"><span class="ln">6985 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam is fine with that.</span>
<a name="l6986"><span class="ln">6986 </span></a><span class="s0">Please don’t come back.</span>
<a name="l6987"><span class="ln">6987 </span></a><span class="s0">After a few deep gulps, he crawls out.</span>
<a name="l6988"><span class="ln">6988 </span></a><span class="s0">He grabs his backpack and opens the door a crack.</span>
<a name="l6989"><span class="ln">6989 </span></a><span class="s0">The hall is empty.</span>
<a name="l6990"><span class="ln">6990 </span></a><span class="s0">Unfortunately downstairs has no walls to hide behind.</span>
<a name="l6991"><span class="ln">6991 </span></a><span class="s0">When did he get so careless?</span>
<a name="l6992"><span class="ln">6992 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t put it off.</span>
<a name="l6993"><span class="ln">6993 </span></a><span class="s0">He slips out of the warm office, his false safety.</span>
<a name="l6994"><span class="ln">6994 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s doing this.</span>
<a name="l6995"><span class="ln">6995 </span></a><span class="s0">The damage is immense.</span>
<a name="l6996"><span class="ln">6996 </span></a><span class="s0">There truly are half a million people down there.</span>
<a name="l6997"><span class="ln">6997 </span></a><span class="s0">A baby cries.</span>
<a name="l6998"><span class="ln">6998 </span></a><span class="s0">A plate breaks.</span>
<a name="l6999"><span class="ln">6999 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone yells for them to turn it down.</span>
<a name="l7000"><span class="ln">7000 </span></a><span class="s0">No, turn it off.</span>
<a name="l7001"><span class="ln">7001 </span></a><span class="s0">No, get ready for lunch.</span>
<a name="l7002"><span class="ln">7002 </span></a><span class="s0">Get the baby.</span>
<a name="l7003"><span class="ln">7003 </span></a><span class="s0">Wash your hands.</span>
<a name="l7004"><span class="ln">7004 </span></a><span class="s0">Stop eating all the corn chips.</span>
<a name="l7005"><span class="ln">7005 </span></a><span class="s0">Faces light up.</span>
<a name="l7006"><span class="ln">7006 </span></a><span class="s0">They are all hopelessly consumed with each other.</span>
<a name="l7007"><span class="ln">7007 </span></a><span class="s0">Drunk on people and noise and food.</span>
<a name="l7008"><span class="ln">7008 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam can do this.</span>
<a name="l7009"><span class="ln">7009 </span></a><span class="s0">Isn’t that his entire life?</span>
<a name="l7010"><span class="ln">7010 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam moves for the stairs, hand on the rail.</span>
<a name="l7011"><span class="ln">7011 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood pulses in his ears.</span>
<a name="l7012"><span class="ln">7012 </span></a><span class="s0">Do not look at her at all.</span>
<a name="l7013"><span class="ln">7013 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyebrows are angry forests.</span>
<a name="l7014"><span class="ln">7014 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dude, I don’t even recognise you,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l7015"><span class="ln">7015 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t you know how Sundays work?</span>
<a name="l7016"><span class="ln">7016 </span></a><span class="s0">The exit is officially an ocean away.</span>
<a name="l7017"><span class="ln">7017 </span></a><span class="s0">They could all see him if only they looked up.</span>
<a name="l7018"><span class="ln">7018 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re shooed along by another boy.</span>
<a name="l7019"><span class="ln">7019 </span></a><span class="s0">But the boy beats him to it.</span>
<a name="l7020"><span class="ln">7020 </span></a><span class="s0">But – oh wait.</span>
<a name="l7021"><span class="ln">7021 </span></a><span class="s0">He stole a shirt.</span>
<a name="l7022"><span class="ln">7022 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s probably unique.</span>
<a name="l7023"><span class="ln">7023 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s probably special.</span>
<a name="l7024"><span class="ln">7024 </span></a><span class="s0">He didn’t mean to be here.</span>
<a name="l7025"><span class="ln">7025 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Jeremy’s friend?’ The boy sighs.</span>
<a name="l7026"><span class="ln">7026 </span></a><span class="s0">Did he even tell you how Sundays work?</span>
<a name="l7027"><span class="ln">7027 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You look shell-shocked.</span>
<a name="l7028"><span class="ln">7028 </span></a><span class="s0">Hit him and run.</span>
<a name="l7029"><span class="ln">7029 </span></a><span class="s0">He nearly does.</span>
<a name="l7030"><span class="ln">7030 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he’s gone.</span>
<a name="l7031"><span class="ln">7031 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam might be having a panic attack.</span>
<a name="l7032"><span class="ln">7032 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh, you must be one of Jeremy’s friends, right?</span>
<a name="l7033"><span class="ln">7033 </span></a><span class="s0">And he’s nodding.</span>
<a name="l7034"><span class="ln">7034 </span></a><span class="s0">What is he supposed to do?</span>
<a name="l7035"><span class="ln">7035 </span></a><span class="s0">Just a little.</span>
<a name="l7036"><span class="ln">7036 </span></a><span class="s0">Well, what the hell, right?</span>
<a name="l7037"><span class="ln">7037 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s officially taken house burglary to the next level.</span>
<a name="l7038"><span class="ln">7038 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s stealing families and their Sunday lunches.</span>
<a name="l7039"><span class="ln">7039 </span></a><span class="s0">Faces blur together.</span>
<a name="l7040"><span class="ln">7040 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s totally fine with that.</span>
<a name="l7041"><span class="ln">7041 </span></a><span class="s0">But he won’t press his luck.</span>
<a name="l7042"><span class="ln">7042 </span></a><span class="s0">His pulse stutters.</span>
<a name="l7043"><span class="ln">7043 </span></a><span class="s0">Well, he knew he’d get caught, didn’t he?</span>
<a name="l7044"><span class="ln">7044 </span></a><span class="s0">He deserves the shriek of intruder.</span>
<a name="l7045"><span class="ln">7045 </span></a><span class="s0">Except it doesn’t come.</span>
<a name="l7046"><span class="ln">7046 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I was just leaving—’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l7047"><span class="ln">7047 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Kitchen.’ She claps her hands together briskly.</span>
<a name="l7048"><span class="ln">7048 </span></a><span class="s0">Dishwasher is already full.</span>
<a name="l7049"><span class="ln">7049 </span></a><span class="s0">After all, he did eat their food.</span>
<a name="l7050"><span class="ln">7050 </span></a><span class="s0">This entire day is doing his head in.</span>
<a name="l7051"><span class="ln">7051 </span></a><span class="s0">Plates keep coming.</span>
<a name="l7052"><span class="ln">7052 </span></a><span class="s0">He wipes his sodden hands on his shirt.</span>
<a name="l7053"><span class="ln">7053 </span></a><span class="s0">He takes one.</span>
<a name="l7054"><span class="ln">7054 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Take two,’ says the man.</span>
<a name="l7055"><span class="ln">7055 </span></a><span class="s0">Did they leave you with the dishes?</span>
<a name="l7056"><span class="ln">7056 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re now playing cricket on the street.</span>
<a name="l7057"><span class="ln">7057 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll leave the plate here.</span>
<a name="l7058"><span class="ln">7058 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so pathetic, right?</span>
<a name="l7059"><span class="ln">7059 </span></a><span class="s0">That he’d lap this up.</span>
<a name="l7060"><span class="ln">7060 </span></a><span class="s0">The girl still looks at Sam.</span>
<a name="l7061"><span class="ln">7061 </span></a><span class="s0">‘So,’ says the girl.</span>
<a name="l7062"><span class="ln">7062 </span></a><span class="s0">She’s going to talk to him?</span>
<a name="l7063"><span class="ln">7063 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re kind of small compared to Jeremy’s usual strays.</span>
<a name="l7064"><span class="ln">7064 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I don’t trust you.’ Sam’s throat is dry.</span>
<a name="l7065"><span class="ln">7065 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well, I don’t trust whoever killed this pot.</span>
<a name="l7066"><span class="ln">7066 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That was me.’ Oh.</span>
<a name="l7067"><span class="ln">7067 </span></a><span class="s0">He notices there’s handsewn embroidery all over the skirt.</span>
<a name="l7068"><span class="ln">7068 </span></a><span class="s0">So she’s the seamstress.</span>
<a name="l7069"><span class="ln">7069 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well,’ Moxie says, ‘it sucked.</span>
<a name="l7070"><span class="ln">7070 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How was your trip?’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l7071"><span class="ln">7071 </span></a><span class="s0">‘The camping trip you boys all went on?</span>
<a name="l7072"><span class="ln">7072 </span></a><span class="s0">You all need to shower, by the way.</span>
<a name="l7073"><span class="ln">7073 </span></a><span class="s0">For hours.’ Sam can play along, right?</span>
<a name="l7074"><span class="ln">7074 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s got this.</span>
<a name="l7075"><span class="ln">7075 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh, well … it was great.</span>
<a name="l7076"><span class="ln">7076 </span></a><span class="s0">Good, um, weather.’ What do you even say about camping?</span>
<a name="l7077"><span class="ln">7077 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s never been camping.</span>
<a name="l7078"><span class="ln">7078 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Chatty, aren’t you?’ Moxie licks brownie off her thumb.</span>
<a name="l7079"><span class="ln">7079 </span></a><span class="s0">Why is he still talking?</span>
<a name="l7080"><span class="ln">7080 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Excuse you,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l7081"><span class="ln">7081 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Speaking of being disagreeable,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l7082"><span class="ln">7082 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Why hasn’t Jeremy come to rescue you anyway?</span>
<a name="l7083"><span class="ln">7083 </span></a><span class="s0">Technically now I’m yours.</span>
<a name="l7084"><span class="ln">7084 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey, we’re going to the beach,’ a boy tells Moxie.</span>
<a name="l7085"><span class="ln">7085 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hi,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l7086"><span class="ln">7086 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Are you Moxie’s friend?</span>
<a name="l7087"><span class="ln">7087 </span></a><span class="s0">She doesn’t usually invite people over.’ He smiles.</span>
<a name="l7088"><span class="ln">7088 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m Jeremy.’ No, I’m supposed to be your friend.</span>
<a name="l7089"><span class="ln">7089 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ah, yeah, Moxie’s friend,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l7090"><span class="ln">7090 </span></a><span class="s0">Get out of there, man.</span>
<a name="l7091"><span class="ln">7091 </span></a><span class="s0">We’re going to the beach.</span>
<a name="l7092"><span class="ln">7092 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not going to the beach with them.</span>
<a name="l7093"><span class="ln">7093 </span></a><span class="s0">Because why not.</span>
<a name="l7094"><span class="ln">7094 </span></a><span class="s0">Just don’t ask me who I am.</span>
<a name="l7095"><span class="ln">7095 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy reappears, eating leftover potato salad with a soup ladle.</span>
<a name="l7096"><span class="ln">7096 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ready?’ he says to no one in particular.</span>
<a name="l7097"><span class="ln">7097 </span></a><span class="s0">Is Moxie back yet?</span>
<a name="l7098"><span class="ln">7098 </span></a><span class="s0">What’s she doing up there?’ He raises his voice.</span>

<a name="l7100"><span class="ln">7100 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Girls,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l7101"><span class="ln">7101 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack yelps and grabs his side like he’s been shot.</span>
<a name="l7102"><span class="ln">7102 </span></a><span class="s0">The hordes pour towards the door.</span>
<a name="l7103"><span class="ln">7103 </span></a><span class="s0">And Moxie is nearly a head shorter than everyone else.</span>
<a name="l7104"><span class="ln">7104 </span></a><span class="s0">He wonders if she’s his age.</span>
<a name="l7105"><span class="ln">7105 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants this.</span>
<a name="l7106"><span class="ln">7106 </span></a><span class="s0">He absolutely can’t have it.</span>
<a name="l7107"><span class="ln">7107 </span></a><span class="s0">She catches his eye and he looks away.</span>
<a name="l7108"><span class="ln">7108 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Coming, dishwasher boy?’ It’s because they don’t know him.</span>
<a name="l7109"><span class="ln">7109 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s absolutely mad, of course, to follow them.</span>
<a name="l7110"><span class="ln">7110 </span></a><span class="s0">How could you?</span>
<a name="l7111"><span class="ln">7111 </span></a><span class="s0">They don’t know him.</span>
<a name="l7112"><span class="ln">7112 </span></a><span class="s0">Why the police want him.</span>
<a name="l7113"><span class="ln">7113 </span></a><span class="s0">Why his aunt won’t even look at him.</span>
<a name="l7114"><span class="ln">7114 </span></a><span class="s0">And it feels good.</span>
<a name="l7115"><span class="ln">7115 </span></a><span class="s0">She glances sideways at Sam.</span>
<a name="l7116"><span class="ln">7116 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Are you swimming in jeans?</span>
<a name="l7117"><span class="ln">7117 </span></a><span class="s0">She bats it off and glares.</span>
<a name="l7118"><span class="ln">7118 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Eh, just swim in your boxers,’ Jeremy says lightly.</span>
<a name="l7119"><span class="ln">7119 </span></a><span class="s0">He jerks the hem down quickly.</span>
<a name="l7120"><span class="ln">7120 </span></a><span class="s0">She purses her lips together, like she’ll ask.</span>
<a name="l7121"><span class="ln">7121 </span></a><span class="s0">Please don’t ask.</span>
<a name="l7122"><span class="ln">7122 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s deep enough.</span>
<a name="l7123"><span class="ln">7123 </span></a><span class="s0">We threw Jack in headfirst to test it once.</span>
<a name="l7124"><span class="ln">7124 </span></a><span class="s0">No broken neck.’ ‘Pity,’ mutters Moxie.</span>
<a name="l7125"><span class="ln">7125 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And definitely don’t do anything Jack wouldn’t do.</span>
<a name="l7126"><span class="ln">7126 </span></a><span class="s0">Actually, don’t do anything Jack would do.</span>
<a name="l7127"><span class="ln">7127 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam finds himself looking anywhere but at her indigo bikini.</span>
<a name="l7128"><span class="ln">7128 </span></a><span class="s0">And then realises how conspicuous that is.</span>
<a name="l7129"><span class="ln">7129 </span></a><span class="s0">And then realises he’s blushing.</span>
<a name="l7130"><span class="ln">7130 </span></a><span class="s0">And then decides he needs to go drown.</span>
<a name="l7131"><span class="ln">7131 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie never so much walks as marches with angry intensity.</span>
<a name="l7132"><span class="ln">7132 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy pats Sam on the shoulder.</span>
<a name="l7133"><span class="ln">7133 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You look nervous.</span>
<a name="l7134"><span class="ln">7134 </span></a><span class="s0">The water seems deep.</span>
<a name="l7135"><span class="ln">7135 </span></a><span class="s0">The rocks are hot.</span>
<a name="l7136"><span class="ln">7136 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack ignores her, eyes lighting on Sam.</span>
<a name="l7137"><span class="ln">7137 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s heart still crawls into his mouth.</span>
<a name="l7138"><span class="ln">7138 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks away.</span>
<a name="l7139"><span class="ln">7139 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t imagine Avery enjoying this day.</span>
<a name="l7140"><span class="ln">7140 </span></a><span class="s0">He tries, but he just can’t.</span>
<a name="l7141"><span class="ln">7141 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey!’ someone says, a note of panic in their voice.</span>
<a name="l7142"><span class="ln">7142 </span></a><span class="s0">Does it matter?</span>
<a name="l7143"><span class="ln">7143 </span></a><span class="s0">And the sea hits him.</span>
<a name="l7144"><span class="ln">7144 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s shockingly cool.</span>
<a name="l7145"><span class="ln">7145 </span></a><span class="s0">Then his head splits the surface.</span>
<a name="l7146"><span class="ln">7146 </span></a><span class="s0">Where was the part where he stayed low profile?</span>
<a name="l7147"><span class="ln">7147 </span></a><span class="s0">Something like anger.</span>
<a name="l7148"><span class="ln">7148 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy treads water and then splashes water into Sam’s face.</span>
<a name="l7149"><span class="ln">7149 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Maniac.’ But he’s smiling.</span>
<a name="l7150"><span class="ln">7150 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s not hard.’ ‘Oi!</span>
<a name="l7151"><span class="ln">7151 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sam?’ But he says it like a question.</span>
<a name="l7152"><span class="ln">7152 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well, get up here.</span>
<a name="l7153"><span class="ln">7153 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy dodges and gets a mouthful of ocean.</span>
<a name="l7154"><span class="ln">7154 </span></a><span class="s0">He goes under garbling.</span>
<a name="l7155"><span class="ln">7155 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Get up here, kid.</span>
<a name="l7156"><span class="ln">7156 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m keeping you.</span>
<a name="l7157"><span class="ln">7157 </span></a><span class="s0">Underwater, no one but the ocean sees him smile.</span>
<a name="l7158"><span class="ln">7158 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy is seven and maybe Avery is dead.</span>
<a name="l7159"><span class="ln">7159 </span></a><span class="s0">They drove all night.</span>
<a name="l7160"><span class="ln">7160 </span></a><span class="s0">Please please please.</span>
<a name="l7161"><span class="ln">7161 </span></a><span class="s0">The car pulls into a driveway, the engine rattles off.</span>
<a name="l7162"><span class="ln">7162 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy, now with Avery’s head in his lap, goes stiff.</span>
<a name="l7163"><span class="ln">7163 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he hammers the front door.</span>
<a name="l7164"><span class="ln">7164 </span></a><span class="s0">Karen, open up.’ A dog across the street barks.</span>
<a name="l7165"><span class="ln">7165 </span></a><span class="s0">A slow car rumbles past.</span>
<a name="l7166"><span class="ln">7166 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery shifts in his arms.</span>
<a name="l7167"><span class="ln">7167 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s something wrong with Avery’s eyes.</span>
<a name="l7168"><span class="ln">7168 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re dull and broken and hollow.</span>
<a name="l7169"><span class="ln">7169 </span></a><span class="s0">He drags Avery out.</span>
<a name="l7170"><span class="ln">7170 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery doesn’t even whimper.</span>
<a name="l7171"><span class="ln">7171 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Be on your best behaviour.’ His voice is raw.</span>
<a name="l7172"><span class="ln">7172 </span></a><span class="s0">Her lips are a line.</span>
<a name="l7173"><span class="ln">7173 </span></a><span class="s0">Her brow furrows.</span>
<a name="l7174"><span class="ln">7174 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What’s going on, Clay?’ she snaps.</span>
<a name="l7175"><span class="ln">7175 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I just told you, Jen isn’t here.</span>
<a name="l7176"><span class="ln">7176 </span></a><span class="s0">His aunt stares.</span>
<a name="l7177"><span class="ln">7177 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I haven’t seen you kids in four years.</span>
<a name="l7178"><span class="ln">7178 </span></a><span class="s0">No, six.’ ‘I’m Sammy,’ he whispers.</span>
<a name="l7179"><span class="ln">7179 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t remember her.</span>
<a name="l7180"><span class="ln">7180 </span></a><span class="s0">Like, in his head, their dad hasn’t stopped hitting him.</span>
<a name="l7181"><span class="ln">7181 </span></a><span class="s0">Then his dad yells.</span>
<a name="l7182"><span class="ln">7182 </span></a><span class="s0">Then Aunt Karen yells.</span>
<a name="l7183"><span class="ln">7183 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy wants to cover Avery’s ears.</span>
<a name="l7184"><span class="ln">7184 </span></a><span class="s0">His whole trembling body.</span>
<a name="l7185"><span class="ln">7185 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone has to protect him.</span>
<a name="l7186"><span class="ln">7186 </span></a><span class="s0">But he can do this.</span>
<a name="l7187"><span class="ln">7187 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he turns on his boys, eyes molten pools.</span>
<a name="l7188"><span class="ln">7188 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s chest tightens.</span>
<a name="l7189"><span class="ln">7189 </span></a><span class="s0">But his dad just holds out the toy car.</span>
<a name="l7190"><span class="ln">7190 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s chest tightens, a fist on his lungs.</span>
<a name="l7191"><span class="ln">7191 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he snatches the car.</span>
<a name="l7192"><span class="ln">7192 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Because that’s where it ends, Sammy boy.</span>
<a name="l7193"><span class="ln">7193 </span></a><span class="s0">He wouldn’t give them to his dad anyway.</span>
<a name="l7194"><span class="ln">7194 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen comes back inside, rewrapping her tulip dressing gown.</span>
<a name="l7195"><span class="ln">7195 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Is he coming back soon?’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l7196"><span class="ln">7196 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen closes her eyes.</span>
<a name="l7197"><span class="ln">7197 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re staying with me for a while.</span>
<a name="l7198"><span class="ln">7198 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen sighs and reaches for Avery.</span>
<a name="l7199"><span class="ln">7199 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Avery,’ she snaps.</span>
<a name="l7200"><span class="ln">7200 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Let me help.</span>
<a name="l7201"><span class="ln">7201 </span></a><span class="s0">To stand on top of the wicker chair and scream.</span>
<a name="l7202"><span class="ln">7202 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyes are burned out blue.</span>
<a name="l7203"><span class="ln">7203 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t take his—’ Sammy says, but it’s too late.</span>
<a name="l7204"><span class="ln">7204 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery starts screaming.</span>
<a name="l7205"><span class="ln">7205 </span></a><span class="s0">And he just doesn’t stop.</span>
<a name="l7206"><span class="ln">7206 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam hesitates on the stairs.</span>
<a name="l7207"><span class="ln">7207 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You might as well stay for dinner,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l7208"><span class="ln">7208 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sunday night is waffles.’ Sam stays.</span>
<a name="l7209"><span class="ln">7209 </span></a><span class="s0">The house has emptied considerably.</span>
<a name="l7210"><span class="ln">7210 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie’s dad waves from the kitchen.</span>
<a name="l7211"><span class="ln">7211 </span></a><span class="s0">Hopefully that’s a joke.</span>
<a name="l7212"><span class="ln">7212 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How many are staying, Jeremy?’ he says.</span>
<a name="l7213"><span class="ln">7213 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’re teenage boys.’ Jeremy smacks him playfully on the head.</span>
<a name="l7214"><span class="ln">7214 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Only six of us guys left.</span>
<a name="l7215"><span class="ln">7215 </span></a><span class="s0">Thanks for remembering me.</span>
<a name="l7216"><span class="ln">7216 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t forget Jack’s new adopted hatchling Sam.’ Sam shrinks.</span>
<a name="l7217"><span class="ln">7217 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t help it.</span>
<a name="l7218"><span class="ln">7218 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Did you swim in your clothes?</span>
<a name="l7219"><span class="ln">7219 </span></a><span class="s0">Their father wisely makes more waffles.</span>
<a name="l7220"><span class="ln">7220 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dude, don’t you ever eat?</span>
<a name="l7221"><span class="ln">7221 </span></a><span class="s0">Please consume at least nineteen waffles tonight.</span>
<a name="l7222"><span class="ln">7222 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He could wear a towel?’ Sam feels a little panicky.</span>
<a name="l7223"><span class="ln">7223 </span></a><span class="s0">Then she notices.</span>
<a name="l7224"><span class="ln">7224 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What?’ She looks at them and then at Sam.</span>
<a name="l7225"><span class="ln">7225 </span></a><span class="s0">No.’ ‘Come on, he’s your height,’ Jeremy says.</span>
<a name="l7226"><span class="ln">7226 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll clean his clothes super fast.</span>
<a name="l7227"><span class="ln">7227 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks up to three concerned faces.</span>
<a name="l7228"><span class="ln">7228 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Look, he’s gone and caught cold,’ Jeremy says reproachfully.</span>
<a name="l7229"><span class="ln">7229 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I had the flu already,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l7230"><span class="ln">7230 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s nothing.’ The father turns back to the griddle.</span>
<a name="l7231"><span class="ln">7231 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Wet clothes aren’t helping.</span>
<a name="l7232"><span class="ln">7232 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie …’ He casts her a meaningful look.</span>
<a name="l7233"><span class="ln">7233 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie throws her hands in the air.</span>
<a name="l7234"><span class="ln">7234 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh, fine.’ She stabs a finger at him.</span>
<a name="l7235"><span class="ln">7235 </span></a><span class="s0">Or would he be?</span>
<a name="l7236"><span class="ln">7236 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not exactly a stranger any more.</span>
<a name="l7237"><span class="ln">7237 </span></a><span class="s0">He showed Jack how to do a backflip.</span>
<a name="l7238"><span class="ln">7238 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone tipped sand down his shirt.</span>
<a name="l7239"><span class="ln">7239 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s eaten their potato salad and worn their clothes.</span>
<a name="l7240"><span class="ln">7240 </span></a><span class="s0">The trouble is he stole it all, every moment.</span>
<a name="l7241"><span class="ln">7241 </span></a><span class="s0">And that’s the part people don’t overlook.</span>
<a name="l7242"><span class="ln">7242 </span></a><span class="s0">They feel betrayed.</span>
<a name="l7243"><span class="ln">7243 </span></a><span class="s0">Betrayed people have the hardest fists.</span>
<a name="l7244"><span class="ln">7244 </span></a><span class="s0">This whole family is really forceful.</span>
<a name="l7245"><span class="ln">7245 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But these are girls’ jeans …’ Sam starts.</span>
<a name="l7246"><span class="ln">7246 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie abruptly releases him and narrows her eyes.</span>
<a name="l7247"><span class="ln">7247 </span></a><span class="s0">‘If they don’t fit, then we’ll discuss,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l7248"><span class="ln">7248 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But they’re big on me anyway.</span>
<a name="l7249"><span class="ln">7249 </span></a><span class="s0">Towels under the sink.</span>
<a name="l7250"><span class="ln">7250 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Jeremy,’ she clarifies.</span>
<a name="l7251"><span class="ln">7251 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Jeremy does laundry.</span>
<a name="l7252"><span class="ln">7252 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack does yard work.</span>
<a name="l7253"><span class="ln">7253 </span></a><span class="s0">Grady is supposed to houseclean, but he whinges about allergies.</span>
<a name="l7254"><span class="ln">7254 </span></a><span class="s0">I look after the babies way too much.</span>
<a name="l7255"><span class="ln">7255 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That bruise looked pretty vicious.</span>
<a name="l7256"><span class="ln">7256 </span></a><span class="s0">What happened?’ Lies run through Sam’s head.</span>
<a name="l7257"><span class="ln">7257 </span></a><span class="s0">None tumble out of his mouth.</span>
<a name="l7258"><span class="ln">7258 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hmm,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l7259"><span class="ln">7259 </span></a><span class="s0">He gets a real hot shower.</span>
<a name="l7260"><span class="ln">7260 </span></a><span class="s0">With real soap.</span>
<a name="l7261"><span class="ln">7261 </span></a><span class="s0">He feels like Moxie chose it on purpose.</span>
<a name="l7262"><span class="ln">7262 </span></a><span class="s0">The tone downstairs is as worn out as he feels.</span>
<a name="l7263"><span class="ln">7263 </span></a><span class="s0">Then she slides it back to him.</span>
<a name="l7264"><span class="ln">7264 </span></a><span class="s0">‘The De Lainey special.</span>
<a name="l7265"><span class="ln">7265 </span></a><span class="s0">The rest of the little kids were my Uncle Robin’s.</span>
<a name="l7266"><span class="ln">7266 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Six hellion cousins there.</span>
<a name="l7267"><span class="ln">7267 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe she won’t think too hard about it?</span>
<a name="l7268"><span class="ln">7268 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No, Grady’s the oldest,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l7269"><span class="ln">7269 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy and Jack are next.</span>
<a name="l7270"><span class="ln">7270 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I heard that,’ Dash says.</span>
<a name="l7271"><span class="ln">7271 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie rolls her eyes.</span>
<a name="l7272"><span class="ln">7272 </span></a><span class="s0">So he’s left to slide a tentative question at her.</span>
<a name="l7273"><span class="ln">7273 </span></a><span class="s0">Not that he has any right to ask.</span>
<a name="l7274"><span class="ln">7274 </span></a><span class="s0">Not that he should be drawing attention to himself.</span>
<a name="l7275"><span class="ln">7275 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And you?’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l7276"><span class="ln">7276 </span></a><span class="s0">Grady uses a spoon as a bookmark and looks up.</span>
<a name="l7277"><span class="ln">7277 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam should leave before Moxie asks more questions.</span>
<a name="l7278"><span class="ln">7278 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam feels sick around adults.</span>
<a name="l7279"><span class="ln">7279 </span></a><span class="s0">But there are still waffles left and … well, waffles.</span>
<a name="l7280"><span class="ln">7280 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Wishful,’ their father says, ‘but no.</span>
<a name="l7281"><span class="ln">7281 </span></a><span class="s0">Absolutely not, Dad.’ ‘I’ll take the weekends,’ their father says.</span>
<a name="l7282"><span class="ln">7282 </span></a><span class="s0">Except that he is.</span>
<a name="l7283"><span class="ln">7283 </span></a><span class="s0">Her father’s voice stays unfailingly mild.</span>
<a name="l7284"><span class="ln">7284 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sweetie, I’m not trying to make it that way.</span>
<a name="l7285"><span class="ln">7285 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr De Lainey builds houses?</span>
<a name="l7286"><span class="ln">7286 </span></a><span class="s0">His heart beats a little faster.</span>
<a name="l7287"><span class="ln">7287 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Right, so we’re sorted?’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l7288"><span class="ln">7288 </span></a><span class="s0">Gotcha.’ Their father’s lips thin.</span>
<a name="l7289"><span class="ln">7289 </span></a><span class="s0">And we talked about this.</span>
<a name="l7290"><span class="ln">7290 </span></a><span class="s0">And there are …’ His voice thickens.</span>
<a name="l7291"><span class="ln">7291 </span></a><span class="s0">Grady immediately gathers plates and mumbles something about loving building.</span>
<a name="l7292"><span class="ln">7292 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You can knock off at three,’ his dad says.</span>
<a name="l7293"><span class="ln">7293 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Moxie.’ Their father gently nudges her shoulder.</span>
<a name="l7294"><span class="ln">7294 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Murmph.’ ‘Look, it’s just the babies.</span>
<a name="l7295"><span class="ln">7295 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’re going to make a film!</span>
<a name="l7296"><span class="ln">7296 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And I was going to work on my design portfolio.</span>
<a name="l7297"><span class="ln">7297 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m alone and broken.’ Her father starts clearing up plates.</span>
<a name="l7298"><span class="ln">7298 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You can still sew.</span>
<a name="l7299"><span class="ln">7299 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll take over as soon as I get home.</span>
<a name="l7300"><span class="ln">7300 </span></a><span class="s0">And when school starts, we’ll get the babies in daycare.</span>
<a name="l7301"><span class="ln">7301 </span></a><span class="s0">This deadline is a beast.’ ‘Fine.</span>
<a name="l7302"><span class="ln">7302 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sure your folks aren’t spoiling your summer plans, eh?</span>
<a name="l7303"><span class="ln">7303 </span></a><span class="s0">The lights flick off.</span>
<a name="l7304"><span class="ln">7304 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie flops on the sofa next to Sam.</span>
<a name="l7305"><span class="ln">7305 </span></a><span class="s0">It was the only available seat, he tells himself.</span>
<a name="l7306"><span class="ln">7306 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s why she sat next to him.</span>
<a name="l7307"><span class="ln">7307 </span></a><span class="s0">All at once.</span>
<a name="l7308"><span class="ln">7308 </span></a><span class="s0">Even though the movie seriously freaks him out.</span>
<a name="l7309"><span class="ln">7309 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s plenty of air.</span>
<a name="l7310"><span class="ln">7310 </span></a><span class="s0">But his lungs don’t quite work any more.</span>
<a name="l7311"><span class="ln">7311 </span></a><span class="s0">Stop twitching your fingers.</span>
<a name="l7312"><span class="ln">7312 </span></a><span class="s0">Like they’re seeing him, really seeing him.</span>
<a name="l7313"><span class="ln">7313 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam opens his mouth – to defend himself?</span>
<a name="l7314"><span class="ln">7314 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Did you see his face?</span>
<a name="l7315"><span class="ln">7315 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How is his hearing so good?’ Jeremy pats his shoulder.</span>
<a name="l7316"><span class="ln">7316 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Only for you and your swearing, buddy.</span>
<a name="l7317"><span class="ln">7317 </span></a><span class="s0">His face is so hot, his clothes so tight.</span>
<a name="l7318"><span class="ln">7318 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam wants to bury himself.</span>
<a name="l7319"><span class="ln">7319 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You nearly pissed yourself,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l7320"><span class="ln">7320 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy hits him.</span>
<a name="l7321"><span class="ln">7321 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie is still laughing silently, a hand over her mouth.</span>
<a name="l7322"><span class="ln">7322 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sorry.’ Her voice is soft as sand and sea.</span>
<a name="l7323"><span class="ln">7323 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I shouldn’t have laughed.</span>
<a name="l7324"><span class="ln">7324 </span></a><span class="s0">Pathetic, pathetic Sam.</span>
<a name="l7325"><span class="ln">7325 </span></a><span class="s0">‘There’s still part two,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l7326"><span class="ln">7326 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam might be sick.</span>
<a name="l7327"><span class="ln">7327 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s past eleven.’ Moxie licks popcorn salt off her thumb.</span>
<a name="l7328"><span class="ln">7328 </span></a><span class="s0">This is the part where Sam slips away.</span>
<a name="l7329"><span class="ln">7329 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll never have this again.</span>
<a name="l7330"><span class="ln">7330 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to leave.</span>
<a name="l7331"><span class="ln">7331 </span></a><span class="s0">Friends that Sam’s supposed to be leaving with.</span>
<a name="l7332"><span class="ln">7332 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam looks at the stairs.</span>
<a name="l7333"><span class="ln">7333 </span></a><span class="s0">He wouldn’t dare.</span>
<a name="l7334"><span class="ln">7334 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyes rest on Sam.</span>
<a name="l7335"><span class="ln">7335 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Thanks for coming, Sam,’ says Mr De Lainey.</span>
<a name="l7336"><span class="ln">7336 </span></a><span class="s0">He remembers Sam’s name?</span>
<a name="l7337"><span class="ln">7337 </span></a><span class="s0">‘See you again soon, son.</span>
<a name="l7338"><span class="ln">7338 </span></a><span class="s0">You wouldn’t dare— Sam’s throat is tight.</span>
<a name="l7339"><span class="ln">7339 </span></a><span class="s0">He reaches for the kettle and a mug.</span>
<a name="l7340"><span class="ln">7340 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam bolts for the stairs.</span>
<a name="l7341"><span class="ln">7341 </span></a><span class="s0">No one will notice if he doesn’t come back downstairs.</span>
<a name="l7342"><span class="ln">7342 </span></a><span class="s0">No one will go into that office this late.</span>
<a name="l7343"><span class="ln">7343 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll leave tomorrow.</span>
<a name="l7344"><span class="ln">7344 </span></a><span class="s0">One last night that feels strangely like … home.</span>
<a name="l7345"><span class="ln">7345 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy is eight and it’s war at the kitchen table.</span>
<a name="l7346"><span class="ln">7346 </span></a><span class="s0">He gets overwhelmed and cries.</span>
<a name="l7347"><span class="ln">7347 </span></a><span class="s0">He gets that way about a lot of things.</span>
<a name="l7348"><span class="ln">7348 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s getting too much for Aunt Karen to pin down.</span>
<a name="l7349"><span class="ln">7349 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s why she’s on the phone.</span>
<a name="l7350"><span class="ln">7350 </span></a><span class="s0">‘—complete rubbish, Clay.</span>
<a name="l7351"><span class="ln">7351 </span></a><span class="s0">The phone call, however, he understands just fine.</span>
<a name="l7352"><span class="ln">7352 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not want these goddamn boys.</span>
<a name="l7353"><span class="ln">7353 </span></a><span class="s0">A forever scar.</span>
<a name="l7354"><span class="ln">7354 </span></a><span class="s0">Their aunt gives a frustrated shout and then goes silent.</span>
<a name="l7355"><span class="ln">7355 </span></a><span class="s0">She strides into the kitchen, all hard edges and splinters.</span>
<a name="l7356"><span class="ln">7356 </span></a><span class="s0">His ear still smarts from being caught and slapped too.</span>
<a name="l7357"><span class="ln">7357 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s legs freeze, mid-swing, shoelaces making a final clack.</span>
<a name="l7358"><span class="ln">7358 </span></a><span class="s0">Like Avery is trying to be difficult.</span>
<a name="l7359"><span class="ln">7359 </span></a><span class="s0">Frantic fluttering crawls up Sammy’s throat.</span>
<a name="l7360"><span class="ln">7360 </span></a><span class="s0">That can’t happen.</span>
<a name="l7361"><span class="ln">7361 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s Avery’s protector, his everything.</span>
<a name="l7362"><span class="ln">7362 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not listening.</span>
<a name="l7363"><span class="ln">7363 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s words come choked.</span>
<a name="l7364"><span class="ln">7364 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But, please, you c-can’t.</span>
<a name="l7365"><span class="ln">7365 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Fine.’ She stomps to the kitchen.</span>
<a name="l7366"><span class="ln">7366 </span></a><span class="s0">He loves those.</span>
<a name="l7367"><span class="ln">7367 </span></a><span class="s0">It hurts him.</span>
<a name="l7368"><span class="ln">7368 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy could tell her this if she listened.</span>
<a name="l7369"><span class="ln">7369 </span></a><span class="s0">If anyone listened.</span>
<a name="l7370"><span class="ln">7370 </span></a><span class="s0">But he is the invisible boy and no one cares.</span>
<a name="l7371"><span class="ln">7371 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s eyes widen.</span>
<a name="l7372"><span class="ln">7372 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen spins on Sammy.</span>
<a name="l7373"><span class="ln">7373 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Stay out there like animals then!’ The door slams.</span>
<a name="l7374"><span class="ln">7374 </span></a><span class="s0">The lock clicks.</span>
<a name="l7375"><span class="ln">7375 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re used to this, but it’s cold tonight.</span>
<a name="l7376"><span class="ln">7376 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s hands flutter.</span>
<a name="l7377"><span class="ln">7377 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I c-c-can’t—’ ‘I know.’ Sammy pets his arm.</span>
<a name="l7378"><span class="ln">7378 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Just let me think.</span>
<a name="l7379"><span class="ln">7379 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I could steal some tools.’ Excitement flickers in his voice.</span>
<a name="l7380"><span class="ln">7380 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I could steal some biscuits too.</span>
<a name="l7381"><span class="ln">7381 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyes are just sad.</span>
<a name="l7382"><span class="ln">7382 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Can you do that?’ Avery whispers.</span>
<a name="l7383"><span class="ln">7383 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Steal houses?’ ‘Yeah,’ Sammy says.</span>
<a name="l7384"><span class="ln">7384 </span></a><span class="s0">It sounds very traumatic.</span>
<a name="l7385"><span class="ln">7385 </span></a><span class="s0">The two little kids are tag-team crying.</span>
<a name="l7386"><span class="ln">7386 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack and Moxie lock in a shouting match.</span>
<a name="l7387"><span class="ln">7387 </span></a><span class="s0">No one can find car keys.</span>
<a name="l7388"><span class="ln">7388 </span></a><span class="s0">Dash says she’s leaving home.</span>
<a name="l7389"><span class="ln">7389 </span></a><span class="s0">Goodbyes are hollered.</span>
<a name="l7390"><span class="ln">7390 </span></a><span class="s0">The front door slams.</span>
<a name="l7391"><span class="ln">7391 </span></a><span class="s0">Engines fade down the road.</span>
<a name="l7392"><span class="ln">7392 </span></a><span class="s0">He picks up.</span>
<a name="l7393"><span class="ln">7393 </span></a><span class="s0">Puts it back.</span>
<a name="l7394"><span class="ln">7394 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s obviously saving this for worst-case scenarios.</span>
<a name="l7395"><span class="ln">7395 </span></a><span class="s0">But Sam is a thief.</span>
<a name="l7396"><span class="ln">7396 </span></a><span class="s0">This is what he does, isn’t it?</span>
<a name="l7397"><span class="ln">7397 </span></a><span class="s0">He pokes his head out the door.</span>
<a name="l7398"><span class="ln">7398 </span></a><span class="s0">The house is suddenly quiet.</span>
<a name="l7399"><span class="ln">7399 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam slips across the hall and peeks through the stairwell.</span>
<a name="l7400"><span class="ln">7400 </span></a><span class="s0">A De Laineyflavoured explosion has hit.</span>
<a name="l7401"><span class="ln">7401 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Quit it, Toby,’ she orders.</span>
<a name="l7402"><span class="ln">7402 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re having a bath.</span>
<a name="l7403"><span class="ln">7403 </span></a><span class="s0">Water turns on.</span>
<a name="l7404"><span class="ln">7404 </span></a><span class="s0">Toby howls like he’s being murdered.</span>
<a name="l7405"><span class="ln">7405 </span></a><span class="s0">The baby toddles after them, cradling a pot of jam.</span>
<a name="l7406"><span class="ln">7406 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s getaway path is clear.</span>
<a name="l7407"><span class="ln">7407 </span></a><span class="s0">Except he doesn’t want to get away.</span>
<a name="l7408"><span class="ln">7408 </span></a><span class="s0">But he can’t stay.</span>
<a name="l7409"><span class="ln">7409 </span></a><span class="s0">And also because Avery might be gone.</span>
<a name="l7410"><span class="ln">7410 </span></a><span class="s0">Where else can Sam go?</span>
<a name="l7411"><span class="ln">7411 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks like trouble.</span>
<a name="l7412"><span class="ln">7412 </span></a><span class="s0">The De Lainey cash just slips through his fingers.</span>
<a name="l7413"><span class="ln">7413 </span></a><span class="s0">This is his life.</span>
<a name="l7414"><span class="ln">7414 </span></a><span class="s0">Steal and spend and stay alive.</span>
<a name="l7415"><span class="ln">7415 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam usually comes in the back, but not today.</span>
<a name="l7416"><span class="ln">7416 </span></a><span class="s0">Which is why, distracted, he walks straight into the boss.</span>
<a name="l7417"><span class="ln">7417 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sammy Lou.’ He has a voice like old engines.</span>
<a name="l7418"><span class="ln">7418 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s still here.</span>
<a name="l7419"><span class="ln">7419 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sorry,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l7420"><span class="ln">7420 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You know what’s breaking around here?</span>
<a name="l7421"><span class="ln">7421 </span></a><span class="s0">My mind on why I kept that kid on.</span>
<a name="l7422"><span class="ln">7422 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s practised this look for maximum patheticness.</span>
<a name="l7423"><span class="ln">7423 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m really sorry for distracting him.</span>
<a name="l7424"><span class="ln">7424 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Just don’t distract him.</span>
<a name="l7425"><span class="ln">7425 </span></a><span class="s0">So Avery got his second chance.</span>
<a name="l7426"><span class="ln">7426 </span></a><span class="s0">His bare arms are stick thin and smeared with grease.</span>
<a name="l7427"><span class="ln">7427 </span></a><span class="s0">Is that about their fight?</span>
<a name="l7428"><span class="ln">7428 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You stayed,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l7429"><span class="ln">7429 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What?’ Avery pauses, arms half lost in the engine.</span>
<a name="l7430"><span class="ln">7430 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What are you talking about?’ ‘The other night?</span>
<a name="l7431"><span class="ln">7431 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s eyes narrow.</span>
<a name="l7432"><span class="ln">7432 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That was just talk.</span>
<a name="l7433"><span class="ln">7433 </span></a><span class="s0">Does my boss know you’re here?</span>
<a name="l7434"><span class="ln">7434 </span></a><span class="s0">So Avery knows what Sam did.</span>
<a name="l7435"><span class="ln">7435 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh, he definitely knows.</span>
<a name="l7436"><span class="ln">7436 </span></a><span class="s0">And this is all Avery’s fault anyway, right?</span>
<a name="l7437"><span class="ln">7437 </span></a><span class="s0">You need this job.’ ‘That was an accident.</span>
<a name="l7438"><span class="ln">7438 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam bites back his pained whimper.</span>
<a name="l7439"><span class="ln">7439 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s voice rises.</span>
<a name="l7440"><span class="ln">7440 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You meant to break someone’s hand.</span>
<a name="l7441"><span class="ln">7441 </span></a><span class="s0">I hate it.</span>
<a name="l7442"><span class="ln">7442 </span></a><span class="s0">Agonising heat flushes Sam’s cheeks.</span>
<a name="l7443"><span class="ln">7443 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants to shove him back, but he can’t.</span>
<a name="l7444"><span class="ln">7444 </span></a><span class="s0">He’d never touch Avery to hurt him.</span>
<a name="l7445"><span class="ln">7445 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You need this job.’ Sam’s voice is low.</span>
<a name="l7446"><span class="ln">7446 </span></a><span class="s0">But his breathing evens out.</span>
<a name="l7447"><span class="ln">7447 </span></a><span class="s0">Shut up about it.’ Avery’s teeth clench.</span>
<a name="l7448"><span class="ln">7448 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I mean it.</span>
<a name="l7449"><span class="ln">7449 </span></a><span class="s0">It drives Sam mad, because Avery is good with engines.</span>
<a name="l7450"><span class="ln">7450 </span></a><span class="s0">But he has to stay calm.</span>
<a name="l7451"><span class="ln">7451 </span></a><span class="s0">Not get overwhelmed.</span>
<a name="l7452"><span class="ln">7452 </span></a><span class="s0">Not let anyone see him freak out.</span>
<a name="l7453"><span class="ln">7453 </span></a><span class="s0">The police must not find the Lou brothers.</span>
<a name="l7454"><span class="ln">7454 </span></a><span class="s0">After what Sam did at school last year?</span>
<a name="l7455"><span class="ln">7455 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam wants to shout: Look, Avery!</span>
<a name="l7456"><span class="ln">7456 </span></a><span class="s0">This is exactly why you can’t be alone!</span>
<a name="l7457"><span class="ln">7457 </span></a><span class="s0">Who’d calm you down if I wasn’t here?</span>
<a name="l7458"><span class="ln">7458 </span></a><span class="s0">This is what brothers do.</span>
<a name="l7459"><span class="ln">7459 </span></a><span class="s0">He fiddles with a loose thread on his jeans.</span>
<a name="l7460"><span class="ln">7460 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t believe he forgot to change.</span>
<a name="l7461"><span class="ln">7461 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll add it to their savings.</span>
<a name="l7462"><span class="ln">7462 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Can we not fight?’ Sam whispers.</span>
<a name="l7463"><span class="ln">7463 </span></a><span class="s0">‘S-stop hurting people.</span>
<a name="l7464"><span class="ln">7464 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Then stop screwing up,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l7465"><span class="ln">7465 </span></a><span class="s0">No one looks twice.</span>
<a name="l7466"><span class="ln">7466 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re here to work.</span>
<a name="l7467"><span class="ln">7467 </span></a><span class="s0">He clearly doesn’t trust Avery alone in the workshop.</span>
<a name="l7468"><span class="ln">7468 </span></a><span class="s0">Which ends up with the Lou brothers analysing tourist targets.</span>
<a name="l7469"><span class="ln">7469 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone happy or affectionate.</span>
<a name="l7470"><span class="ln">7470 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone who’ll care.</span>
<a name="l7471"><span class="ln">7471 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery gives him a sour look.</span>
<a name="l7472"><span class="ln">7472 </span></a><span class="s0">He could use a bath.</span>
<a name="l7473"><span class="ln">7473 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam still has on the smiley-face shirt and Moxie’s jeans.</span>
<a name="l7474"><span class="ln">7474 </span></a><span class="s0">Does she wonder about him?</span>
<a name="l7475"><span class="ln">7475 </span></a><span class="s0">Why’s he even thinking that?</span>
<a name="l7476"><span class="ln">7476 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam rubs the back of his sweaty neck.</span>
<a name="l7477"><span class="ln">7477 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well, we can’t do the one where you fake-vomit.</span>
<a name="l7478"><span class="ln">7478 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m hitting, you’re running.’ Sam gives him a flat look.</span>
<a name="l7479"><span class="ln">7479 </span></a><span class="s0">Obviously that’s how they divide the parts.</span>
<a name="l7480"><span class="ln">7480 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t even fake hitting Avery.</span>
<a name="l7481"><span class="ln">7481 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Stop calling them “jobs”.</span>
<a name="l7482"><span class="ln">7482 </span></a><span class="s0">What do think this is?</span>
<a name="l7483"><span class="ln">7483 </span></a><span class="s0">Like it’s sliding.</span>
<a name="l7484"><span class="ln">7484 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants to catch it before someone falls.</span>
<a name="l7485"><span class="ln">7485 </span></a><span class="s0">He puts it in the bin.</span>
<a name="l7486"><span class="ln">7486 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery stands, anticipation in his jittering arms.</span>
<a name="l7487"><span class="ln">7487 </span></a><span class="s0">Their handbag isn’t quite zipped.</span>
<a name="l7488"><span class="ln">7488 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s hand is in and out before he stands up.</span>
<a name="l7489"><span class="ln">7489 </span></a><span class="s0">Right on the bruise.</span>
<a name="l7490"><span class="ln">7490 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s wince is real.</span>
<a name="l7491"><span class="ln">7491 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You want to run that by me again?’ Avery shouts.</span>
<a name="l7492"><span class="ln">7492 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam slaps his hand away.</span>
<a name="l7493"><span class="ln">7493 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey, take it easy.’ He’s not faking, though.</span>
<a name="l7494"><span class="ln">7494 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s a little too into it today.</span>
<a name="l7495"><span class="ln">7495 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Shut the hell up!’ Avery shoves him again.</span>
<a name="l7496"><span class="ln">7496 </span></a><span class="s0">His neck snaps to the side.</span>
<a name="l7497"><span class="ln">7497 </span></a><span class="s0">His teeth sink into his tongue.</span>
<a name="l7498"><span class="ln">7498 </span></a><span class="s0">His vision fractures.</span>
<a name="l7499"><span class="ln">7499 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery really really forgot to fake that punch.</span>
<a name="l7500"><span class="ln">7500 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood dribbles down his chin.</span>
<a name="l7501"><span class="ln">7501 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone gives a heartfelt gasp.</span>
<a name="l7502"><span class="ln">7502 </span></a><span class="s0">People back off and stare.</span>
<a name="l7503"><span class="ln">7503 </span></a><span class="s0">Voices flood over Sam.</span>
<a name="l7504"><span class="ln">7504 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m fine.’ The words slur without trying.</span>
<a name="l7505"><span class="ln">7505 </span></a><span class="s0">His hand darts toward a back pocket.</span>
<a name="l7506"><span class="ln">7506 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone gives a grateful cry.</span>
<a name="l7507"><span class="ln">7507 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Here comes a security guard!’ Sam’s body tenses.</span>
<a name="l7508"><span class="ln">7508 </span></a><span class="s0">They need to run now.</span>
<a name="l7509"><span class="ln">7509 </span></a><span class="s0">But she’s paused, wipes halfway to the baby’s face.</span>
<a name="l7510"><span class="ln">7510 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie stares at him.</span>
<a name="l7511"><span class="ln">7511 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam jerks away.</span>
<a name="l7512"><span class="ln">7512 </span></a><span class="s0">Did she see his face?</span>
<a name="l7513"><span class="ln">7513 </span></a><span class="s0">She wouldn’t have.</span>
<a name="l7514"><span class="ln">7514 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s Sam’s fault.</span>
<a name="l7515"><span class="ln">7515 </span></a><span class="s0">He let himself get distracted.</span>
<a name="l7516"><span class="ln">7516 </span></a><span class="s0">They should be gone by now.</span>
<a name="l7517"><span class="ln">7517 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam doesn’t think.</span>
<a name="l7518"><span class="ln">7518 </span></a><span class="s0">Hey!’ The person lunges at him.</span>
<a name="l7519"><span class="ln">7519 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam tips two fingers in salute and then— runs.</span>
<a name="l7520"><span class="ln">7520 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he’s gone.</span>
<a name="l7521"><span class="ln">7521 </span></a><span class="s0">He never looks back to see if Sam made it.</span>
<a name="l7522"><span class="ln">7522 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam takes care of himself.</span>
<a name="l7523"><span class="ln">7523 </span></a><span class="s0">The security guard chases, shouting into his walkie-talkie.</span>
<a name="l7524"><span class="ln">7524 </span></a><span class="s0">Noise runs over his back.</span>
<a name="l7525"><span class="ln">7525 </span></a><span class="s0">Bodies shove him out the way.</span>
<a name="l7526"><span class="ln">7526 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s lost in a crowd.</span>
<a name="l7527"><span class="ln">7527 </span></a><span class="s0">The last wallet is still in his hand.</span>
<a name="l7528"><span class="ln">7528 </span></a><span class="s0">Not a bad haul.</span>
<a name="l7529"><span class="ln">7529 </span></a><span class="s0">He walks and flips through them.</span>
<a name="l7530"><span class="ln">7530 </span></a><span class="s0">The second is a fat tourist wallet.</span>
<a name="l7531"><span class="ln">7531 </span></a><span class="s0">Fifties and twenties.</span>
<a name="l7532"><span class="ln">7532 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he drops that wallet in a flowerbed.</span>
<a name="l7533"><span class="ln">7533 </span></a><span class="s0">If he can find Avery.</span>
<a name="l7534"><span class="ln">7534 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers press gently at his jaw.</span>
<a name="l7535"><span class="ln">7535 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s not like that’s usual for him, right?</span>
<a name="l7536"><span class="ln">7536 </span></a><span class="s0">But this is Avery.</span>
<a name="l7537"><span class="ln">7537 </span></a><span class="s0">He hates hitting.</span>
<a name="l7538"><span class="ln">7538 </span></a><span class="s0">It doesn’t matter.</span>
<a name="l7539"><span class="ln">7539 </span></a><span class="s0">She’s nobody to him.</span>
<a name="l7540"><span class="ln">7540 </span></a><span class="s0">But he keeps looking.</span>
<a name="l7541"><span class="ln">7541 </span></a><span class="s0">And he sees her again.</span>
<a name="l7542"><span class="ln">7542 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie De Lainey.</span>
<a name="l7543"><span class="ln">7543 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam wonders if she’s talking about him.</span>
<a name="l7544"><span class="ln">7544 </span></a><span class="s0">Yeah sure, Sam.</span>
<a name="l7545"><span class="ln">7545 </span></a><span class="s0">The entire world revolves around you.</span>
<a name="l7546"><span class="ln">7546 </span></a><span class="s0">She probably (definitely) didn’t recognise you.</span>
<a name="l7547"><span class="ln">7547 </span></a><span class="s0">She probably (definitely) didn’t care.</span>
<a name="l7548"><span class="ln">7548 </span></a><span class="s0">STOP.’ Sam’s fingers freeze.</span>
<a name="l7549"><span class="ln">7549 </span></a><span class="s0">His head snaps up.</span>
<a name="l7550"><span class="ln">7550 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam doesn’t even think.</span>
<a name="l7551"><span class="ln">7551 </span></a><span class="s0">Cars stream forward.</span>
<a name="l7552"><span class="ln">7552 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s shoes hit the road.</span>
<a name="l7553"><span class="ln">7553 </span></a><span class="s0">He twists so his back is to the oncoming car.</span>
<a name="l7554"><span class="ln">7554 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Moxie,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l7555"><span class="ln">7555 </span></a><span class="s0">Just a whisper.</span>
<a name="l7556"><span class="ln">7556 </span></a><span class="s0">Just a breath.</span>
<a name="l7557"><span class="ln">7557 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s all happened so fast.</span>
<a name="l7558"><span class="ln">7558 </span></a><span class="s0">No chance to think.</span>
<a name="l7559"><span class="ln">7559 </span></a><span class="s0">A horn blasts.</span>
<a name="l7560"><span class="ln">7560 </span></a><span class="s0">Undone shoelaces twist around Sam’s ankles.</span>
<a name="l7561"><span class="ln">7561 </span></a><span class="s0">He takes a breath.</span>
<a name="l7562"><span class="ln">7562 </span></a><span class="s0">The car hits.</span>
<a name="l7563"><span class="ln">7563 </span></a><span class="s0">Then the world stammers to an abrupt halt.</span>
<a name="l7564"><span class="ln">7564 </span></a><span class="s0">It doesn’t hurt.</span>
<a name="l7565"><span class="ln">7565 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t care.</span>
<a name="l7566"><span class="ln">7566 </span></a><span class="s0">Car doors slam.</span>
<a name="l7567"><span class="ln">7567 </span></a><span class="s0">Voices rise in panicked flurry.</span>
<a name="l7568"><span class="ln">7568 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood, hot and thick and metallic, coats Sam’s arms.</span>
<a name="l7569"><span class="ln">7569 </span></a><span class="s0">He pushes himself up.</span>
<a name="l7570"><span class="ln">7570 </span></a><span class="s0">Let me call an ambulance—’ The driver is sobbing.</span>
<a name="l7571"><span class="ln">7571 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone has a phone out, frantically dialling.</span>
<a name="l7572"><span class="ln">7572 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No.’ Sam tastes hot bitumen, salty blood.</span>
<a name="l7573"><span class="ln">7573 </span></a><span class="s0">He scrambles to his feet.</span>
<a name="l7574"><span class="ln">7574 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks for Moxie.</span>
<a name="l7575"><span class="ln">7575 </span></a><span class="s0">Their backs are to Sam.</span>
<a name="l7576"><span class="ln">7576 </span></a><span class="s0">Their father’s shoulders shake.</span>
<a name="l7577"><span class="ln">7577 </span></a><span class="s0">But there’s not a scratch on the little boy.</span>
<a name="l7578"><span class="ln">7578 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam clutches at the car hood for a second.</span>
<a name="l7579"><span class="ln">7579 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m fine.’ Moxie looks up over her father’s shoulder.</span>
<a name="l7580"><span class="ln">7580 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam turns away.</span>
<a name="l7581"><span class="ln">7581 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s fine, he’s fine fine fine.</span>
<a name="l7582"><span class="ln">7582 </span></a><span class="s0">His body screams so he just runs faster.</span>
<a name="l7583"><span class="ln">7583 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood slicks down his arms.</span>
<a name="l7584"><span class="ln">7584 </span></a><span class="s0">Just get away.</span>
<a name="l7585"><span class="ln">7585 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t let people see.</span>
<a name="l7586"><span class="ln">7586 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t let them notice.</span>
<a name="l7587"><span class="ln">7587 </span></a><span class="s0">The footpath ends here.</span>
<a name="l7588"><span class="ln">7588 </span></a><span class="s0">He sinks into the gutter, grabbing his stomach.</span>
<a name="l7589"><span class="ln">7589 </span></a><span class="s0">The ground pulses and agony flashes in his guts.</span>
<a name="l7590"><span class="ln">7590 </span></a><span class="s0">He puts his head between his legs and vomits.</span>
<a name="l7591"><span class="ln">7591 </span></a><span class="s0">Tears spill next, hot and fat down his cheeks.</span>
<a name="l7592"><span class="ln">7592 </span></a><span class="s0">A shadow falls over his head.</span>
<a name="l7593"><span class="ln">7593 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Whoa,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l7594"><span class="ln">7594 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sammy.’ His voice is high and panicked.</span>
<a name="l7595"><span class="ln">7595 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What the hell, Sammy?</span>
<a name="l7596"><span class="ln">7596 </span></a><span class="s0">You could’ve died!</span>
<a name="l7597"><span class="ln">7597 </span></a><span class="s0">Why would you even – you idiot.</span>
<a name="l7598"><span class="ln">7598 </span></a><span class="s0">You cc-could’ve died!</span>
<a name="l7599"><span class="ln">7599 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam hurts he hurts he hurts.</span>
<a name="l7600"><span class="ln">7600 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I don’t need a hospital.</span>
<a name="l7601"><span class="ln">7601 </span></a><span class="s0">Shut up, OK?</span>
<a name="l7602"><span class="ln">7602 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re lying.’ Sam glances sideways at him.</span>
<a name="l7603"><span class="ln">7603 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s hands spin as he crouches by Sam.</span>
<a name="l7604"><span class="ln">7604 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Avery,’ he whispers, ‘it was a little kid.</span>
<a name="l7605"><span class="ln">7605 </span></a><span class="s0">So just shut up.’ Avery grabs Sam’s shoulder.</span>
<a name="l7606"><span class="ln">7606 </span></a><span class="s0">We’ll go to my friend’s place.’ Oh, great.</span>
<a name="l7607"><span class="ln">7607 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No,’ Sam says, voice rough.</span>
<a name="l7608"><span class="ln">7608 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I don’t like them.’ ‘What?</span>
<a name="l7609"><span class="ln">7609 </span></a><span class="s0">‘She’ll call the police on us.</span>
<a name="l7610"><span class="ln">7610 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You don’t understand a single freaking thing.</span>
<a name="l7611"><span class="ln">7611 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyes go blank, guttered out.</span>
<a name="l7612"><span class="ln">7612 </span></a><span class="s0">When their dad hit him.</span>
<a name="l7613"><span class="ln">7613 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery just shuts down.</span>
<a name="l7614"><span class="ln">7614 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam has never made him do that before.</span>
<a name="l7615"><span class="ln">7615 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery rises and skitters back.</span>
<a name="l7616"><span class="ln">7616 </span></a><span class="s0">And he runs.</span>
<a name="l7617"><span class="ln">7617 </span></a><span class="s0">Anger suddenly whitens behind Sam’s eyes.</span>
<a name="l7618"><span class="ln">7618 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam shoves to his feet and limps down the street.</span>
<a name="l7619"><span class="ln">7619 </span></a><span class="s0">People stare, but he focuses ahead.</span>
<a name="l7620"><span class="ln">7620 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks over his shoulder.</span>
<a name="l7621"><span class="ln">7621 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery hasn’t come back.</span>
<a name="l7622"><span class="ln">7622 </span></a><span class="s0">Because it hurts.</span>
<a name="l7623"><span class="ln">7623 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s the only reason.</span>
<a name="l7624"><span class="ln">7624 </span></a><span class="s0">No one notices Sam.</span>
<a name="l7625"><span class="ln">7625 </span></a><span class="s0">Obviously he should go steal another house.</span>
<a name="l7626"><span class="ln">7626 </span></a><span class="s0">But he’s not staked anything out.</span>
<a name="l7627"><span class="ln">7627 </span></a><span class="s0">It could take for ever to find one.</span>
<a name="l7628"><span class="ln">7628 </span></a><span class="s0">And he hurts.</span>
<a name="l7629"><span class="ln">7629 </span></a><span class="s0">He hurts too much to pick a lock.</span>
<a name="l7630"><span class="ln">7630 </span></a><span class="s0">He hurts too much to rob a family.</span>
<a name="l7631"><span class="ln">7631 </span></a><span class="s0">He hurts too much to breathe.</span>
<a name="l7632"><span class="ln">7632 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s not an option.</span>
<a name="l7633"><span class="ln">7633 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t even know them.</span>
<a name="l7634"><span class="ln">7634 </span></a><span class="s0">They don’t know him.</span>
<a name="l7635"><span class="ln">7635 </span></a><span class="s0">They wouldn’t want to know him.</span>
<a name="l7636"><span class="ln">7636 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam can’t just sneak back in.</span>
<a name="l7637"><span class="ln">7637 </span></a><span class="s0">If you count how he hits things.</span>
<a name="l7638"><span class="ln">7638 </span></a><span class="s0">He wonders if Moxie is back.</span>
<a name="l7639"><span class="ln">7639 </span></a><span class="s0">If she recognised him.</span>
<a name="l7640"><span class="ln">7640 </span></a><span class="s0">If Toby is really all right.</span>
<a name="l7641"><span class="ln">7641 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t just go in.</span>
<a name="l7642"><span class="ln">7642 </span></a><span class="s0">Unless … Unless he says he’s Moxie’s friend.</span>
<a name="l7643"><span class="ln">7643 </span></a><span class="s0">Depends on who’s asking.</span>
<a name="l7644"><span class="ln">7644 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to come up with a story.</span>
<a name="l7645"><span class="ln">7645 </span></a><span class="s0">He … fell?</span>
<a name="l7646"><span class="ln">7646 </span></a><span class="s0">Good one, Sam.</span>
<a name="l7647"><span class="ln">7647 </span></a><span class="s0">No one will see through that.</span>
<a name="l7648"><span class="ln">7648 </span></a><span class="s0">You want to con someone?</span>
<a name="l7649"><span class="ln">7649 </span></a><span class="s0">Like they’re expecting him.</span>
<a name="l7650"><span class="ln">7650 </span></a><span class="s0">It hurts to stand straight, but he’ll do it.</span>
<a name="l7651"><span class="ln">7651 </span></a><span class="s0">The front door is already open.</span>
<a name="l7652"><span class="ln">7652 </span></a><span class="s0">He raps knuckles on the doorframe.</span>
<a name="l7653"><span class="ln">7653 </span></a><span class="s0">A hand shoots up from the sofa and waves vaguely.</span>
<a name="l7654"><span class="ln">7654 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Come in,’ says a tired voice.</span>
<a name="l7655"><span class="ln">7655 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Unless you’re an axe murderer.</span>
<a name="l7656"><span class="ln">7656 </span></a><span class="s0">Then stay out or whatever.’ ‘Wow, Jeremy.</span>
<a name="l7657"><span class="ln">7657 </span></a><span class="s0">That was convincing.</span>
<a name="l7658"><span class="ln">7658 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam steps in, muscles coiled.</span>
<a name="l7659"><span class="ln">7659 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s Sam.’ Jeremy’s head pops up from behind the sofa.</span>
<a name="l7660"><span class="ln">7660 </span></a><span class="s0">A soft grin spreads across his face.</span>
<a name="l7661"><span class="ln">7661 </span></a><span class="s0">Here for Moxie?’ Sam comes in a little further.</span>
<a name="l7662"><span class="ln">7662 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s committed now, isn’t he?</span>
<a name="l7663"><span class="ln">7663 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh, right.’ Jeremy flops back down.</span>
<a name="l7664"><span class="ln">7664 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t see Sam at all now.</span>
<a name="l7665"><span class="ln">7665 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Moxie is out,’ Jack says.</span>

<a name="l7668"><span class="ln">7668 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam realises they don’t know what happened to Toby.</span>
<a name="l7669"><span class="ln">7669 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s been an hour, maybe two, and Moxie hasn’t returned.</span>
<a name="l7670"><span class="ln">7670 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe Toby is actually hurt?</span>
<a name="l7671"><span class="ln">7671 </span></a><span class="s0">He slips towards the staircase.</span>
<a name="l7672"><span class="ln">7672 </span></a><span class="s0">His heart rabbits so fast he can scarcely think.</span>
<a name="l7673"><span class="ln">7673 </span></a><span class="s0">What the hell is he doing?</span>

<a name="l7675"><span class="ln">7675 </span></a><span class="s0">But he is.</span>

<a name="l7677"><span class="ln">7677 </span></a><span class="s0">He presses that to his side and nearly passes out.</span>
<a name="l7678"><span class="ln">7678 </span></a><span class="s0">When is he going to grow some freaking brains?</span>
<a name="l7679"><span class="ln">7679 </span></a><span class="s0">Like the glorious idiot he is.</span>

<a name="l7683"><span class="ln">7683 </span></a><span class="s0">Now.’ Jeremy’s voice drifts from downstairs, sweet and innocent.</span>
<a name="l7684"><span class="ln">7684 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t be insensitive, bro.</span>
<a name="l7685"><span class="ln">7685 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I am so sick of both of you,’ Grady hollers.</span>
<a name="l7686"><span class="ln">7686 </span></a><span class="s0">Please go downstairs.</span>
<a name="l7687"><span class="ln">7687 </span></a><span class="s0">He clicks the office door shut.</span>
<a name="l7688"><span class="ln">7688 </span></a><span class="s0">And he’s alone.</span>
<a name="l7689"><span class="ln">7689 </span></a><span class="s0">It’ll end badly.</span>

<a name="l7691"><span class="ln">7691 </span></a><span class="s0">Sink to his knees and cry.</span>
<a name="l7692"><span class="ln">7692 </span></a><span class="s0">The noise downstairs suddenly escalates and Sam’s shoulders tighten.</span>
<a name="l7693"><span class="ln">7693 </span></a><span class="s0">A baby shrieks.</span>
<a name="l7694"><span class="ln">7694 </span></a><span class="s0">Toby really is fine.</span>

<a name="l7698"><span class="ln">7698 </span></a><span class="s0">He cracks open the office door to hear better.</span>
<a name="l7699"><span class="ln">7699 </span></a><span class="s0">And then he’ll have to run again.</span>
<a name="l7700"><span class="ln">7700 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy is ten and he lost Avery.</span>

<a name="l7704"><span class="ln">7704 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery is supposed to wait.</span>
<a name="l7705"><span class="ln">7705 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy rips apart the school grounds looking.</span>

<a name="l7707"><span class="ln">7707 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe he walked home alone?</span>
<a name="l7708"><span class="ln">7708 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s not even sure he could without getting lost.</span>
<a name="l7709"><span class="ln">7709 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy runs the whole way, tattered backpack punching his spine.</span>
<a name="l7710"><span class="ln">7710 </span></a><span class="s0">He dumps it by their letterbox and runs inside.</span>
<a name="l7711"><span class="ln">7711 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Where’s Avery?’ he gasps.</span>
<a name="l7712"><span class="ln">7712 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen flicks her cigarette in the sink.</span>

<a name="l7717"><span class="ln">7717 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen’s lips thin.</span>

<a name="l7720"><span class="ln">7720 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll show up when he wants to.’ She doesn’t understand.</span>
<a name="l7721"><span class="ln">7721 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy doesn’t wait.</span>
<a name="l7722"><span class="ln">7722 </span></a><span class="s0">He goes to the park, full of prickles and rubbish.</span>
<a name="l7723"><span class="ln">7723 </span></a><span class="s0">He flies across footpaths.</span>
<a name="l7724"><span class="ln">7724 </span></a><span class="s0">To the shops.</span>
<a name="l7725"><span class="ln">7725 </span></a><span class="s0">Back to school.</span>
<a name="l7726"><span class="ln">7726 </span></a><span class="s0">Back to the streets.</span>

<a name="l7728"><span class="ln">7728 </span></a><span class="s0">He runs anyway.</span>
<a name="l7729"><span class="ln">7729 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy trails, dejected and exhausted, back to his street.</span>
<a name="l7730"><span class="ln">7730 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery could be dead.</span>
<a name="l7731"><span class="ln">7731 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s all Sammy’s fault.</span>
<a name="l7732"><span class="ln">7732 </span></a><span class="s0">His heartbeat stutters and fear pricks his skin.</span>
<a name="l7733"><span class="ln">7733 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s a glimpse of whiteblond hair.</span>
<a name="l7734"><span class="ln">7734 </span></a><span class="s0">He has energy after all.</span>
<a name="l7735"><span class="ln">7735 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sorry,’ Sammy says.</span>
<a name="l7736"><span class="ln">7736 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sorry, he’s s-sorry, we’re so so sorry.</span>
<a name="l7737"><span class="ln">7737 </span></a><span class="s0">He didn’t mean it.</span>
<a name="l7738"><span class="ln">7738 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s running his toy car up and down his face.</span>
<a name="l7739"><span class="ln">7739 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey, whoa there, little mate.</span>
<a name="l7740"><span class="ln">7740 </span></a><span class="s0">This is your brother?’ ‘I’m Sammy Lou,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l7741"><span class="ln">7741 </span></a><span class="s0">He has a split lip, but he smiles anyway.</span>
<a name="l7742"><span class="ln">7742 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’re bringing your brother home.</span>
<a name="l7743"><span class="ln">7743 </span></a><span class="s0">Not taking him away.’ Sammy thinks he might cry.</span>
<a name="l7744"><span class="ln">7744 </span></a><span class="s0">He will not cry.</span>
<a name="l7745"><span class="ln">7745 </span></a><span class="s0">There are folded arms and frowns.</span>
<a name="l7746"><span class="ln">7746 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Come on, little mate,’ says the cop.</span>
<a name="l7747"><span class="ln">7747 </span></a><span class="s0">Digging in like a bite.</span>
<a name="l7748"><span class="ln">7748 </span></a><span class="s0">Like a barnacle.</span>
<a name="l7749"><span class="ln">7749 </span></a><span class="s0">The cop staggers in surprise, and then laughs.</span>
<a name="l7750"><span class="ln">7750 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy hops after them, teeth chattering.</span>
<a name="l7751"><span class="ln">7751 </span></a><span class="s0">They must’ve been so, so nice to him.</span>
<a name="l7752"><span class="ln">7752 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen’s face is stony as they arrive.</span>
<a name="l7753"><span class="ln">7753 </span></a><span class="s0">The cop’s cut lip.</span>
<a name="l7754"><span class="ln">7754 </span></a><span class="s0">You can’t hit a cop.</span>
<a name="l7755"><span class="ln">7755 </span></a><span class="s0">He didn’t mean to.’ The woman gives a small smile.</span>
<a name="l7756"><span class="ln">7756 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ah, you must be Sammy.</span>
<a name="l7757"><span class="ln">7757 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery needed him and he wasn’t there.</span>
<a name="l7758"><span class="ln">7758 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Please,’ Sammy whispers.</span>
<a name="l7759"><span class="ln">7759 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He wasn’t gone for that long.’ ‘Five hours,’ Sammy says.</span>
<a name="l7760"><span class="ln">7760 </span></a><span class="s0">His aunt shoots him a poisoned look.</span>
<a name="l7761"><span class="ln">7761 </span></a><span class="s0">The lady cop folds her arms.</span>
<a name="l7762"><span class="ln">7762 </span></a><span class="s0">And Aunt Karen has to listen.</span>
<a name="l7763"><span class="ln">7763 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Come on, kiddo, home now.</span>
<a name="l7764"><span class="ln">7764 </span></a><span class="s0">Safe and sound.’ Finally Avery lets go.</span>
<a name="l7765"><span class="ln">7765 </span></a><span class="s0">Too old for cars.</span>
<a name="l7766"><span class="ln">7766 </span></a><span class="s0">Too old to be carried.</span>
<a name="l7767"><span class="ln">7767 </span></a><span class="s0">Too old not to know his way home.</span>
<a name="l7768"><span class="ln">7768 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy nearly smiles.</span>
<a name="l7769"><span class="ln">7769 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m lost,’ Avery whispers.</span>
<a name="l7770"><span class="ln">7770 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Not any more.’ Sammy casts damp eyes to the cop.</span>
<a name="l7771"><span class="ln">7771 </span></a><span class="s0">He tucks his hands behind his back.</span>
<a name="l7772"><span class="ln">7772 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No.’ The cop raises an eyebrow.</span>
<a name="l7773"><span class="ln">7773 </span></a><span class="s0">‘All right, Sammy, let’s talk seriously for a moment.</span>
<a name="l7774"><span class="ln">7774 </span></a><span class="s0">The cop nods, the lightness gone from his smile.</span>
<a name="l7775"><span class="ln">7775 </span></a><span class="s0">A lot of trouble.</span>
<a name="l7776"><span class="ln">7776 </span></a><span class="s0">You sort yourself out, hey?</span>
<a name="l7777"><span class="ln">7777 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s a lie, the nod.</span>
<a name="l7778"><span class="ln">7778 </span></a><span class="s0">The cop wouldn’t understand.</span>
<a name="l7779"><span class="ln">7779 </span></a><span class="s0">If kids hurt Avery, then what else can Sammy do?</span>
<a name="l7780"><span class="ln">7780 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to hit them.</span>
<a name="l7781"><span class="ln">7781 </span></a><span class="s0">He had to.</span>
<a name="l7782"><span class="ln">7782 </span></a><span class="s0">But he’s not like his dad.</span>
<a name="l7783"><span class="ln">7783 </span></a><span class="s0">He’d never never go too far.</span>
<a name="l7784"><span class="ln">7784 </span></a><span class="s0">The police leave.</span>
<a name="l7785"><span class="ln">7785 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen locks the door and marches into the kitchen.</span>
<a name="l7786"><span class="ln">7786 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ve had enough of this, Avery.</span>
<a name="l7787"><span class="ln">7787 </span></a><span class="s0">You know better.</span>
<a name="l7788"><span class="ln">7788 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy shoves between them, all fire flares and burning blood.</span>
<a name="l7789"><span class="ln">7789 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy matches Aunt Karen’s eyes, flint for charcoal.</span>
<a name="l7790"><span class="ln">7790 </span></a><span class="s0">Her teeth clench.</span>
<a name="l7791"><span class="ln">7791 </span></a><span class="s0">‘If you think he’ll learn from it, you’re wrong.</span>
<a name="l7792"><span class="ln">7792 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy seals his lips tight.</span>
<a name="l7793"><span class="ln">7793 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks at Avery.</span>
<a name="l7794"><span class="ln">7794 </span></a><span class="s0">But Avery doesn’t scream for Aunt Karen to stop.</span>
<a name="l7795"><span class="ln">7795 </span></a><span class="s0">He just looks confused and scared.</span>
<a name="l7796"><span class="ln">7796 </span></a><span class="s0">No one saves Sammy.</span>
<a name="l7797"><span class="ln">7797 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s OK, right?</span>
<a name="l7798"><span class="ln">7798 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s used to it.</span>
<a name="l7799"><span class="ln">7799 </span></a><span class="s0">So long as his brother is safe.</span>
<a name="l7800"><span class="ln">7800 </span></a><span class="s0">He licks his thumb and flips the page.</span>
<a name="l7801"><span class="ln">7801 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not been in here the entire three days, obviously.</span>
<a name="l7802"><span class="ln">7802 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he cased out a few houses.</span>
<a name="l7803"><span class="ln">7803 </span></a><span class="s0">He just hasn’t … moved … into … them yet.</span>
<a name="l7804"><span class="ln">7804 </span></a><span class="s0">Leftovers, for instance.</span>
<a name="l7805"><span class="ln">7805 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy’s Greek zucchini and halloumi falafel is incredible.</span>
<a name="l7806"><span class="ln">7806 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie’s reheated spring rolls are disgusting.</span>
<a name="l7807"><span class="ln">7807 </span></a><span class="s0">The only worry that gnaws at his chest is Avery.</span>
<a name="l7808"><span class="ln">7808 </span></a><span class="s0">Always, always Avery.</span>
<a name="l7809"><span class="ln">7809 </span></a><span class="s0">He hasn’t seen him in three days.</span>
<a name="l7810"><span class="ln">7810 </span></a><span class="s0">But he’ll be with his friends.</span>
<a name="l7811"><span class="ln">7811 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam licks his thumb and flips another page.</span>
<a name="l7812"><span class="ln">7812 </span></a><span class="s0">He feels so guilty.</span>
<a name="l7813"><span class="ln">7813 </span></a><span class="s0">To bathe in?</span>
<a name="l7814"><span class="ln">7814 </span></a><span class="s0">‘TRY ME.’ A small smile tugs at Sam’s lips.</span>
<a name="l7815"><span class="ln">7815 </span></a><span class="s0">Dust lines the bookshelves.</span>
<a name="l7816"><span class="ln">7816 </span></a><span class="s0">He wonders what happened to the De Laineys’ mother.</span>
<a name="l7817"><span class="ln">7817 </span></a><span class="s0">Did she walk out too?</span>
<a name="l7818"><span class="ln">7818 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam can’t remember his mother’s face.</span>
<a name="l7819"><span class="ln">7819 </span></a><span class="s0">Leaving them with him.</span>
<a name="l7820"><span class="ln">7820 </span></a><span class="s0">Their dad and his fists and his molasses eyes.</span>
<a name="l7821"><span class="ln">7821 </span></a><span class="s0">She’s just another reason to never, never trust adults.</span>
<a name="l7822"><span class="ln">7822 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam drops the book.</span>
<a name="l7823"><span class="ln">7823 </span></a><span class="s0">But he doesn’t have time.</span>
<a name="l7824"><span class="ln">7824 </span></a><span class="s0">‘… because it’s illegal for kids to use glitter, actually.</span>
<a name="l7825"><span class="ln">7825 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I am twenty-five!’ Toby shouts.</span>
<a name="l7826"><span class="ln">7826 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Nice try,’ Moxie says and turns.</span>
<a name="l7827"><span class="ln">7827 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t call the police yet.</span>
<a name="l7828"><span class="ln">7828 </span></a><span class="s0">I can explain.</span>
<a name="l7829"><span class="ln">7829 </span></a><span class="s0">Except he really really can’t.</span>
<a name="l7830"><span class="ln">7830 </span></a><span class="s0">Their eyes meet.</span>
<a name="l7831"><span class="ln">7831 </span></a><span class="s0">Air escapes Sam’s lungs like they’ve been punctured.</span>
<a name="l7832"><span class="ln">7832 </span></a><span class="s0">Toby stands behind her wearing a Batman mask.</span>
<a name="l7833"><span class="ln">7833 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Who’s dat?’ Moxie screams.</span>
<a name="l7834"><span class="ln">7834 </span></a><span class="s0">She hurls the ice cream tub at Sam.</span>
<a name="l7835"><span class="ln">7835 </span></a><span class="s0">The lid pops.</span>
<a name="l7836"><span class="ln">7836 </span></a><span class="s0">The air fills with a soaring, shimmering rainbow arc.</span>
<a name="l7837"><span class="ln">7837 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie keeps screaming.</span>
<a name="l7838"><span class="ln">7838 </span></a><span class="s0">Toby joins in.</span>
<a name="l7839"><span class="ln">7839 </span></a><span class="s0">He jumps the veranda steps and his shoes hit cement.</span>

<a name="l7841"><span class="ln">7841 </span></a><span class="s0">Asking himself why why why did he do this?</span>
<a name="l7842"><span class="ln">7842 </span></a><span class="s0">He didn’t want it to end like this.</span>
<a name="l7843"><span class="ln">7843 </span></a><span class="s0">It rakes his throat.</span>
<a name="l7844"><span class="ln">7844 </span></a><span class="s0">Get away from here.</span>
<a name="l7845"><span class="ln">7845 </span></a><span class="s0">He listens for sirens.</span>
<a name="l7846"><span class="ln">7846 </span></a><span class="s0">For someone to shout stop that thief.</span>
<a name="l7847"><span class="ln">7847 </span></a><span class="s0">Walk, Sammy, just keep walking.</span>
<a name="l7848"><span class="ln">7848 </span></a><span class="s0">Anywhere but here.</span>
<a name="l7849"><span class="ln">7849 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t want to be here.</span>
<a name="l7850"><span class="ln">7850 </span></a><span class="s0">There are simple rules for surviving a lifestyle like his.</span>
<a name="l7851"><span class="ln">7851 </span></a><span class="s0">Number one: don’t get caught.</span>
<a name="l7852"><span class="ln">7852 </span></a><span class="s0">And he freaking blew that.</span>
<a name="l7853"><span class="ln">7853 </span></a><span class="s0">It makes him angry, all over again.</span>
<a name="l7854"><span class="ln">7854 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen’s street wasn’t much better.</span>
<a name="l7855"><span class="ln">7855 </span></a><span class="s0">And Avery’s just trotted right back in.</span>
<a name="l7856"><span class="ln">7856 </span></a><span class="s0">Because it’s familiar.</span>
<a name="l7857"><span class="ln">7857 </span></a><span class="s0">Because it’s home.</span>
<a name="l7858"><span class="ln">7858 </span></a><span class="s0">Yeah OK, the Lou brothers are still criminals.</span>
<a name="l7859"><span class="ln">7859 </span></a><span class="s0">Endless plans as they walked to and from school.</span>
<a name="l7860"><span class="ln">7860 </span></a><span class="s0">All they need is money, right?</span>
<a name="l7861"><span class="ln">7861 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s not impossible.</span>
<a name="l7862"><span class="ln">7862 </span></a><span class="s0">He stops outside a row of apartments.</span>
<a name="l7863"><span class="ln">7863 </span></a><span class="s0">Windows are barred.</span>
<a name="l7864"><span class="ln">7864 </span></a><span class="s0">Piles of junk sit in gutters.</span>
<a name="l7865"><span class="ln">7865 </span></a><span class="s0">Is this even the right number?</span>
<a name="l7866"><span class="ln">7866 </span></a><span class="s0">Does he know anyone who doesn’t want him in jail?</span>
<a name="l7867"><span class="ln">7867 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs new friends.</span>
<a name="l7868"><span class="ln">7868 </span></a><span class="s0">Or any friends.</span>
<a name="l7869"><span class="ln">7869 </span></a><span class="s0">A non-judgemental dog maybe.</span>
<a name="l7870"><span class="ln">7870 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What is my life?’ he mutters and knocks.</span>
<a name="l7871"><span class="ln">7871 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Is Avery Lou there?</span>
<a name="l7872"><span class="ln">7872 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m his brother.’ Silence.</span>
<a name="l7873"><span class="ln">7873 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam kicks the door.</span>
<a name="l7874"><span class="ln">7874 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Wow, it is you,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l7875"><span class="ln">7875 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I thought you hated this place.’ He pauses.</span>
<a name="l7876"><span class="ln">7876 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And me.’ Sam grits his teeth.</span>
<a name="l7877"><span class="ln">7877 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You know that’s not true.</span>
<a name="l7878"><span class="ln">7878 </span></a><span class="s0">Now can I come in?</span>
<a name="l7879"><span class="ln">7879 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m about to be arrested.’ Avery opens the door.</span>
<a name="l7880"><span class="ln">7880 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I guess that’s usual.</span>
<a name="l7881"><span class="ln">7881 </span></a><span class="s0">But I—’ He breaks off with a choke.</span>
<a name="l7882"><span class="ln">7882 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam shoves past, leaving glittering footprints.</span>
<a name="l7883"><span class="ln">7883 </span></a><span class="s0">Honestly, it wouldn’t be that hard to catch him.</span>
<a name="l7884"><span class="ln">7884 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery opens his mouth.</span>
<a name="l7885"><span class="ln">7885 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Just lend me some clothes and—’ Avery bursts out laughing.</span>
<a name="l7886"><span class="ln">7886 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s too much.</span>
<a name="l7887"><span class="ln">7887 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery makes a show of holding his breath.</span>
<a name="l7888"><span class="ln">7888 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam is done.</span>
<a name="l7889"><span class="ln">7889 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s just done.</span>
<a name="l7890"><span class="ln">7890 </span></a><span class="s0">And his brother is a jerk.</span>
<a name="l7891"><span class="ln">7891 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Screw you, Avery,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l7892"><span class="ln">7892 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks so much younger when he’s laughing.</span>
<a name="l7893"><span class="ln">7893 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam hopes he hacks up a lung.</span>
<a name="l7894"><span class="ln">7894 </span></a><span class="s0">The carpet smells like cat piss.</span>
<a name="l7895"><span class="ln">7895 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam rubs the bridge of his nose.</span>
<a name="l7896"><span class="ln">7896 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s a mistake.</span>
<a name="l7897"><span class="ln">7897 </span></a><span class="s0">A creep hiding in her house.</span>
<a name="l7898"><span class="ln">7898 </span></a><span class="s0">Hot, anxious knives carve his stomach.</span>
<a name="l7899"><span class="ln">7899 </span></a><span class="s0">‘So what happened?</span>
<a name="l7900"><span class="ln">7900 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hilarious,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l7901"><span class="ln">7901 </span></a><span class="s0">Crumbs fall out of the folds.</span>
<a name="l7902"><span class="ln">7902 </span></a><span class="s0">Day off.’ But he has too many lying tells.</span>
<a name="l7903"><span class="ln">7903 </span></a><span class="s0">Like how he immediately hunches over, waiting for a blow.</span>
<a name="l7904"><span class="ln">7904 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Shower’s upstairs,’ he says, fast.</span>
<a name="l7905"><span class="ln">7905 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam sighs and follows him upstairs.</span>
<a name="l7906"><span class="ln">7906 </span></a><span class="s0">There are other closed doors, muted voices behind them.</span>
<a name="l7907"><span class="ln">7907 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Um, I don’t know?</span>
<a name="l7908"><span class="ln">7908 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Because I have friends.</span>
<a name="l7909"><span class="ln">7909 </span></a><span class="s0">What exactly is he saying?</span>
<a name="l7910"><span class="ln">7910 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But they’re all way older than you.’ They’re using you.</span>
<a name="l7911"><span class="ln">7911 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re bad news.</span>
<a name="l7912"><span class="ln">7912 </span></a><span class="s0">Are you a getaway driver?</span>
<a name="l7913"><span class="ln">7913 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy does not have the energy for that conversation.</span>
<a name="l7914"><span class="ln">7914 </span></a><span class="s0">About what?’ Avery’s face is so open – so naive.</span>
<a name="l7915"><span class="ln">7915 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam scratches glitter behind his ear.</span>
<a name="l7916"><span class="ln">7916 </span></a><span class="s0">Just do it later.</span>
<a name="l7917"><span class="ln">7917 </span></a><span class="s0">‘About why you’re covered in glitter?’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l7918"><span class="ln">7918 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Never mind,’ says Sam.</span>
<a name="l7919"><span class="ln">7919 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It won’t happen again.’ It will never, never happen again.</span>
<a name="l7920"><span class="ln">7920 </span></a><span class="s0">Just not glitter.</span>
<a name="l7921"><span class="ln">7921 </span></a><span class="s0">He gives up.</span>
<a name="l7922"><span class="ln">7922 </span></a><span class="s0">Why couldn’t Moxie have just slapped him?</span>
<a name="l7923"><span class="ln">7923 </span></a><span class="s0">He needed that fragile paradise.</span>
<a name="l7924"><span class="ln">7924 </span></a><span class="s0">He needed it so he could breathe again.</span>
<a name="l7925"><span class="ln">7925 </span></a><span class="s0">He hesitates over his glitter-covered clothes – De Lainey clothes.</span>
<a name="l7926"><span class="ln">7926 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he stuffs them into a garbage bag.</span>
<a name="l7927"><span class="ln">7927 </span></a><span class="s0">Forget it, Sam.</span>
<a name="l7928"><span class="ln">7928 </span></a><span class="s0">And he’s not alone.</span>
<a name="l7929"><span class="ln">7929 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re both drinking beer.</span>
<a name="l7930"><span class="ln">7930 </span></a><span class="s0">The girl looks him up and down coolly.</span>
<a name="l7931"><span class="ln">7931 </span></a><span class="s0">Once upon a time, it was little cars.</span>
<a name="l7932"><span class="ln">7932 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam tucks his hands into his jean pockets.</span>
<a name="l7933"><span class="ln">7933 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Um, hi … Vin.</span>
<a name="l7934"><span class="ln">7934 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh,’ Avery says, ‘you still look like roadkill.</span>
<a name="l7935"><span class="ln">7935 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam jerks his shirt back down.</span>
<a name="l7936"><span class="ln">7936 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s not why— Is it?</span>
<a name="l7937"><span class="ln">7937 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Avery,’ Sam tries again, voice quiet, ‘can we go?</span>
<a name="l7938"><span class="ln">7938 </span></a><span class="s0">Let’s—’ ‘I’ll take him over,’ Vin says.</span>
<a name="l7939"><span class="ln">7939 </span></a><span class="s0">It freaks him out, what happens when he’s not here.</span>
<a name="l7940"><span class="ln">7940 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam didn’t imagine it’d go this far.</span>
<a name="l7941"><span class="ln">7941 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Be nice,’ Avery whispers.</span>
<a name="l7942"><span class="ln">7942 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam is nice.</span>
<a name="l7943"><span class="ln">7943 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s obviously fixing it up for Vin.</span>
<a name="l7944"><span class="ln">7944 </span></a><span class="s0">Is that why she likes him?</span>
<a name="l7945"><span class="ln">7945 </span></a><span class="s0">The place is open.</span>
<a name="l7946"><span class="ln">7946 </span></a><span class="s0">An unfamiliar man talks with a customer over a car.</span>
<a name="l7947"><span class="ln">7947 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s chest aches.</span>
<a name="l7948"><span class="ln">7948 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam is nice instead of punching Vin in the throat.</span>
<a name="l7949"><span class="ln">7949 </span></a><span class="s0">He knows he’s being unreasonable.</span>
<a name="l7950"><span class="ln">7950 </span></a><span class="s0">The girl is just being decent.</span>
<a name="l7951"><span class="ln">7951 </span></a><span class="s0">No one seems angry.</span>
<a name="l7952"><span class="ln">7952 </span></a><span class="s0">She might think the backpack is full of coins, right?</span>
<a name="l7953"><span class="ln">7953 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s a thief.</span>
<a name="l7954"><span class="ln">7954 </span></a><span class="s0">Coins are logical.</span>
<a name="l7955"><span class="ln">7955 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam scrambles for his seatbelt.</span>
<a name="l7956"><span class="ln">7956 </span></a><span class="s0">She circuits them and pauses by the water edge.</span>
<a name="l7957"><span class="ln">7957 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey!’ Sam’s voice echoes, too shrill.</span>
<a name="l7958"><span class="ln">7958 </span></a><span class="s0">He springs forward.</span>
<a name="l7959"><span class="ln">7959 </span></a><span class="s0">The cry that escapes Sam’s lips is hardly human.</span>
<a name="l7960"><span class="ln">7960 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m letting you go now.</span>
<a name="l7961"><span class="ln">7961 </span></a><span class="s0">His cheeks are wet.</span>
<a name="l7962"><span class="ln">7962 </span></a><span class="s0">His backpack is gone.</span>
<a name="l7963"><span class="ln">7963 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He told me about your crazy habit.’ He told.</span>
<a name="l7964"><span class="ln">7964 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t even understand when he shouldn’t.</span>
<a name="l7965"><span class="ln">7965 </span></a><span class="s0">But how long has he known about the keys?</span>
<a name="l7966"><span class="ln">7966 </span></a><span class="s0">I need a kid like you.</span>
<a name="l7967"><span class="ln">7967 </span></a><span class="s0">A good lock pick.</span>
<a name="l7968"><span class="ln">7968 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But you need to shed the baby face.</span>
<a name="l7969"><span class="ln">7969 </span></a><span class="s0">I mean look at you, kid.</span>
<a name="l7970"><span class="ln">7970 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re crying over a backpack.</span>
<a name="l7971"><span class="ln">7971 </span></a><span class="s0">He couldn’t even explain it to Avery.</span>
<a name="l7972"><span class="ln">7972 </span></a><span class="s0">The keys were promises.</span>
<a name="l7973"><span class="ln">7973 </span></a><span class="s0">They were all he had.</span>
<a name="l7974"><span class="ln">7974 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t struggle.</span>
<a name="l7975"><span class="ln">7975 </span></a><span class="s0">But his arms hang loose at his sides.</span>
<a name="l7976"><span class="ln">7976 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery knew Vin was going to do this.</span>
<a name="l7977"><span class="ln">7977 </span></a><span class="s0">Drugs?’ Vin gives a laugh and slides on aviator sunglasses.</span>
<a name="l7978"><span class="ln">7978 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I know you’re only a kid, so come on.</span>
<a name="l7979"><span class="ln">7979 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll buy you some chips on the way back.</span>
<a name="l7980"><span class="ln">7980 </span></a><span class="s0">Except he doesn’t want to die.</span>
<a name="l7981"><span class="ln">7981 </span></a><span class="s0">We gut houses like you do.</span>
<a name="l7982"><span class="ln">7982 </span></a><span class="s0">They have no idea.</span>
<a name="l7983"><span class="ln">7983 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s not about the stealing from houses.</span>
<a name="l7984"><span class="ln">7984 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s about stealing the houses.</span>
<a name="l7985"><span class="ln">7985 </span></a><span class="s0">Right now, his lungs are rust.</span>
<a name="l7986"><span class="ln">7986 </span></a><span class="s0">He follows Vin.</span>
<a name="l7987"><span class="ln">7987 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery drops down on the sofa where Sam’s sprawled.</span>
<a name="l7988"><span class="ln">7988 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery pokes the back of his neck.</span>
<a name="l7989"><span class="ln">7989 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam doesn’t react.</span>
<a name="l7990"><span class="ln">7990 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I looked at them when you slept.</span>
<a name="l7991"><span class="ln">7991 </span></a><span class="s0">All the time.</span>
<a name="l7992"><span class="ln">7992 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But Vin says—’ Sam flips channels faster.</span>
<a name="l7993"><span class="ln">7993 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Still glittery.’ ‘Surprise,’ Sam says, flat.</span>
<a name="l7994"><span class="ln">7994 </span></a><span class="s0">Isn’t it painfully obvious?</span>
<a name="l7995"><span class="ln">7995 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery chews his thumbnail, eyes on the TV.</span>
<a name="l7996"><span class="ln">7996 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can take care of myself.’ That’s a hilarious joke.</span>
<a name="l7997"><span class="ln">7997 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You didn’t tell me how you got caught,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l7998"><span class="ln">7998 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery looks worried and Sam’s story trails off.</span>
<a name="l7999"><span class="ln">7999 </span></a><span class="s0">It doesn’t matter anyway.</span>
<a name="l8000"><span class="ln">8000 </span></a><span class="s0">There are things with sharper edges to unpack.</span>
<a name="l8001"><span class="ln">8001 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s still isn’t sure how old she is.</span>
<a name="l8002"><span class="ln">8002 </span></a><span class="s0">And it always seems like a rehearsed act.</span>
<a name="l8003"><span class="ln">8003 </span></a><span class="s0">She dumps the greasy paper bag on the coffee table.</span>
<a name="l8004"><span class="ln">8004 </span></a><span class="s0">Then she kisses Avery on the mouth.</span>
<a name="l8005"><span class="ln">8005 </span></a><span class="s0">She kisses a lot of different people, Sam’s noticed.</span>
<a name="l8006"><span class="ln">8006 </span></a><span class="s0">But talking about kissing and sex is too awkward, OK?</span>
<a name="l8007"><span class="ln">8007 </span></a><span class="s0">It shouldn’t be Sam’s job.</span>
<a name="l8008"><span class="ln">8008 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s only fifteen.</span>
<a name="l8009"><span class="ln">8009 </span></a><span class="s0">Except it always is his job.</span>
<a name="l8010"><span class="ln">8010 </span></a><span class="s0">She flops in a sofa and unwraps hers.</span>
<a name="l8011"><span class="ln">8011 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin hasn’t figured it out?</span>
<a name="l8012"><span class="ln">8012 </span></a><span class="s0">Or is this another thing she’s fixing?</span>
<a name="l8013"><span class="ln">8013 </span></a><span class="s0">Eat your food mixed.</span>
<a name="l8014"><span class="ln">8014 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam entirely hates Vin.</span>
<a name="l8015"><span class="ln">8015 </span></a><span class="s0">Why is Avery putting up with it though?</span>
<a name="l8016"><span class="ln">8016 </span></a><span class="s0">Because he likes her?</span>
<a name="l8017"><span class="ln">8017 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam feels sick.</span>
<a name="l8018"><span class="ln">8018 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin licks juice off her thumb.</span>
<a name="l8019"><span class="ln">8019 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How old are you anyway, Sammy?</span>
<a name="l8020"><span class="ln">8020 </span></a><span class="s0">Fourteen?’ Sam frowns.</span>
<a name="l8021"><span class="ln">8021 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t want to do stuff like that.</span>
<a name="l8022"><span class="ln">8022 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin’s eyes narrow.</span>
<a name="l8023"><span class="ln">8023 </span></a><span class="s0">She gets her teeth whitened to prove it.</span>
<a name="l8024"><span class="ln">8024 </span></a><span class="s0">A muscle twitches in Sam’s jaw.</span>
<a name="l8025"><span class="ln">8025 </span></a><span class="s0">All of it.</span>
<a name="l8026"><span class="ln">8026 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam springs towards it, tripping over boxes of stacked junk.</span>
<a name="l8027"><span class="ln">8027 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s up hard against the wall.</span>
<a name="l8028"><span class="ln">8028 </span></a><span class="s0">Her eyes are bottomless and frigid.</span>
<a name="l8029"><span class="ln">8029 </span></a><span class="s0">‘—don’t disagree with me,’ Vin is saying.</span>
<a name="l8030"><span class="ln">8030 </span></a><span class="s0">That kid can fit.’ ‘I said n-no.’ Avery’s voice shakes.</span>
<a name="l8031"><span class="ln">8031 </span></a><span class="s0">His voice takes on a desperate edge.</span>
<a name="l8032"><span class="ln">8032 </span></a><span class="s0">He springs into the kitchen and shoves Vin off.</span>
<a name="l8033"><span class="ln">8033 </span></a><span class="s0">Cutlery slips and clatters to the floor.</span>
<a name="l8034"><span class="ln">8034 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood sprays hot over Sam’s fingers.</span>
<a name="l8035"><span class="ln">8035 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery gives a startled yell and grabs Sam’s waist.</span>
<a name="l8036"><span class="ln">8036 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sammy, don’t—’ But fire blazes in Sam’s lungs.</span>
<a name="l8037"><span class="ln">8037 </span></a><span class="s0">Every time he explodes.</span>
<a name="l8038"><span class="ln">8038 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood soaks her shirt.</span>
<a name="l8039"><span class="ln">8039 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t don’t.’ His voice cracks.</span>
<a name="l8040"><span class="ln">8040 </span></a><span class="s0">‘D-don’t hit people.</span>
<a name="l8041"><span class="ln">8041 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t feel anything.</span>
<a name="l8042"><span class="ln">8042 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s spun out of invincible clouds.</span>
<a name="l8043"><span class="ln">8043 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin raises bloody fingers towards the door.</span>
<a name="l8044"><span class="ln">8044 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Get out.’ Sam’s anger is cooling, leaving his hands shaking.</span>
<a name="l8045"><span class="ln">8045 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Fine.’ His voice feels far away.</span>
<a name="l8046"><span class="ln">8046 </span></a><span class="s0">Tries to grab his wrist.</span>
<a name="l8047"><span class="ln">8047 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery jerks back.</span>
<a name="l8048"><span class="ln">8048 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin’s voice explodes.</span>
<a name="l8049"><span class="ln">8049 </span></a><span class="s0">A door slams upstairs.</span>
<a name="l8050"><span class="ln">8050 </span></a><span class="s0">How could he scare his brother?</span>
<a name="l8051"><span class="ln">8051 </span></a><span class="s0">He trips on the threshold.</span>
<a name="l8052"><span class="ln">8052 </span></a><span class="s0">Then she hurls him out and slams the door.</span>
<a name="l8053"><span class="ln">8053 </span></a><span class="s0">He waits an hour.</span>
<a name="l8054"><span class="ln">8054 </span></a><span class="s0">The lock comes apart under Sam’s thin, light fingers.</span>
<a name="l8055"><span class="ln">8055 </span></a><span class="s0">Except right now, Avery doesn’t want to be around him.</span>
<a name="l8056"><span class="ln">8056 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam scared his brother.</span>
<a name="l8057"><span class="ln">8057 </span></a><span class="s0">He scared his brother.</span>
<a name="l8058"><span class="ln">8058 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to stop doing this, losing it.</span>
<a name="l8059"><span class="ln">8059 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s nothing to take except handfuls of cobwebs.</span>
<a name="l8060"><span class="ln">8060 </span></a><span class="s0">Close your eyes and pretend this is a bed.</span>
<a name="l8061"><span class="ln">8061 </span></a><span class="s0">Pretend you don’t smell stale air and mouse bait.</span>
<a name="l8062"><span class="ln">8062 </span></a><span class="s0">Was she ever happy with them?</span>
<a name="l8063"><span class="ln">8063 </span></a><span class="s0">He puts in the De Lainey father.</span>
<a name="l8064"><span class="ln">8064 </span></a><span class="s0">And then a handful of De Lainey kids.</span>
<a name="l8065"><span class="ln">8065 </span></a><span class="s0">Her eyes meet his, chocolate curls spilling across her cheeks.</span>
<a name="l8066"><span class="ln">8066 </span></a><span class="s0">His words come cracked as a broken plate.</span>
<a name="l8067"><span class="ln">8067 </span></a><span class="s0">The bush waves encouragingly at him.</span>
<a name="l8068"><span class="ln">8068 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam clears his throat.</span>
<a name="l8069"><span class="ln">8069 </span></a><span class="s0">‘This is an apology present.</span>
<a name="l8070"><span class="ln">8070 </span></a><span class="s0">I didn’t steal it.</span>
<a name="l8071"><span class="ln">8071 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sorry?’ The bush does not accept his apology.</span>
<a name="l8072"><span class="ln">8072 </span></a><span class="s0">But he has to try.</span>
<a name="l8073"><span class="ln">8073 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t have anything to lose.</span>
<a name="l8074"><span class="ln">8074 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t have anything.</span>
<a name="l8075"><span class="ln">8075 </span></a><span class="s0">His shoulders ache for his backpack.</span>
<a name="l8076"><span class="ln">8076 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re not allowed to think about Vin.</span>
<a name="l8077"><span class="ln">8077 </span></a><span class="s0">Or how you scared Avery so much he stayed.</span>
<a name="l8078"><span class="ln">8078 </span></a><span class="s0">They need their own home.</span>
<a name="l8079"><span class="ln">8079 </span></a><span class="s0">This can’t go well.</span>
<a name="l8080"><span class="ln">8080 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so screwed.</span>
<a name="l8081"><span class="ln">8081 </span></a><span class="s0">He didn’t take a single key.</span>
<a name="l8082"><span class="ln">8082 </span></a><span class="s0">He feels sick whenever he sees them now.</span>
<a name="l8083"><span class="ln">8083 </span></a><span class="s0">Get up, you spineless coward.</span>
<a name="l8084"><span class="ln">8084 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers curl to knock and then hesitate.</span>
<a name="l8085"><span class="ln">8085 </span></a><span class="s0">His heart stutters.</span>
<a name="l8086"><span class="ln">8086 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam awkwardly holds out the thread.</span>
<a name="l8087"><span class="ln">8087 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s so tiny.</span>
<a name="l8088"><span class="ln">8088 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s such an idiot.</span>
<a name="l8089"><span class="ln">8089 </span></a><span class="s0">Confusion fades from her face and fury washes down.</span>
<a name="l8090"><span class="ln">8090 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sorry,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l8091"><span class="ln">8091 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie slams the door in his face.</span>
<a name="l8092"><span class="ln">8092 </span></a><span class="s0">Well, that’s fair.</span>
<a name="l8093"><span class="ln">8093 </span></a><span class="s0">He deserves that.</span>
<a name="l8094"><span class="ln">8094 </span></a><span class="s0">Boys covered in concrete dust vault out.</span>
<a name="l8095"><span class="ln">8095 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey, is that Sammy?’ He can’t do this.</span>
<a name="l8096"><span class="ln">8096 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t want to be hit.</span>
<a name="l8097"><span class="ln">8097 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sam, wait!’ One of the twins strides around the rosebushes.</span>
<a name="l8098"><span class="ln">8098 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s stupid to come back.</span>
<a name="l8099"><span class="ln">8099 </span></a><span class="s0">That his fists weren’t raised.</span>
<a name="l8100"><span class="ln">8100 </span></a><span class="s0">That maybe he wanted to talk, not to hit.</span>
<a name="l8101"><span class="ln">8101 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t go back to Avery.</span>
<a name="l8102"><span class="ln">8102 </span></a><span class="s0">Or the De Laineys’.</span>
<a name="l8103"><span class="ln">8103 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so, so tired.</span>
<a name="l8104"><span class="ln">8104 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s nearly five.</span>
<a name="l8105"><span class="ln">8105 </span></a><span class="s0">She knocks off from the petrol station around now.</span>
<a name="l8106"><span class="ln">8106 </span></a><span class="s0">She used to.</span>
<a name="l8107"><span class="ln">8107 </span></a><span class="s0">He hasn’t been back in over a year.</span>
<a name="l8108"><span class="ln">8108 </span></a><span class="s0">Her fingers close around shopping bags before she sees him.</span>
<a name="l8109"><span class="ln">8109 </span></a><span class="s0">Like maybe he can make himself look younger, innocent, sorry.</span>
<a name="l8110"><span class="ln">8110 </span></a><span class="s0">What should he say?</span>
<a name="l8111"><span class="ln">8111 </span></a><span class="s0">He forces his feet forward.</span>
<a name="l8112"><span class="ln">8112 </span></a><span class="s0">Tuna, it looks like, powdered milk and rye crackers.</span>
<a name="l8113"><span class="ln">8113 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Are the police chasing you?’ Well, obviously.</span>
<a name="l8114"><span class="ln">8114 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Where’s Avery?’ Aunt Karen says.</span>
<a name="l8115"><span class="ln">8115 </span></a><span class="s0">She lets him.</span>
<a name="l8116"><span class="ln">8116 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He’s OK.’ No, he’s not.</span>
<a name="l8117"><span class="ln">8117 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He, um, works a real job.</span>
<a name="l8118"><span class="ln">8118 </span></a><span class="s0">With a mechanic.’ A lie now.</span>
<a name="l8119"><span class="ln">8119 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Just you.’ Sam looks down.</span>
<a name="l8120"><span class="ln">8120 </span></a><span class="s0">His shoelaces are undone.</span>
<a name="l8121"><span class="ln">8121 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Nothing.’ Sam’s mouth is full of cotton.</span>
<a name="l8122"><span class="ln">8122 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m not taking you back,’ Aunt Karen says.</span>
<a name="l8123"><span class="ln">8123 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You go inside my house and I’m calling the police.</span>
<a name="l8124"><span class="ln">8124 </span></a><span class="s0">I can see your hands, Sammy.</span>
<a name="l8125"><span class="ln">8125 </span></a><span class="s0">Still hitting people?</span>
<a name="l8126"><span class="ln">8126 </span></a><span class="s0">Do you know what you deserve?</span>
<a name="l8127"><span class="ln">8127 </span></a><span class="s0">To be locked up.</span>
<a name="l8128"><span class="ln">8128 </span></a><span class="s0">No second chances.</span>
<a name="l8129"><span class="ln">8129 </span></a><span class="s0">She won’t budge for that either.</span>
<a name="l8130"><span class="ln">8130 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sorry is not enough,’ Aunt Karen says, vicious.</span>
<a name="l8131"><span class="ln">8131 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But can I just have one night?</span>
<a name="l8132"><span class="ln">8132 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam looks desperately at her back, needing her to understand.</span>
<a name="l8133"><span class="ln">8133 </span></a><span class="s0">Truly stop and see him.</span>
<a name="l8134"><span class="ln">8134 </span></a><span class="s0">He runs after her, heart falling through his chest.</span>
<a name="l8135"><span class="ln">8135 </span></a><span class="s0">Her hand shoots up and cracks across his face.</span>
<a name="l8136"><span class="ln">8136 </span></a><span class="s0">It takes a moment for the sting to catch up.</span>
<a name="l8137"><span class="ln">8137 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam stares, his mouth open, red fingerprints across his cheekbone.</span>
<a name="l8138"><span class="ln">8138 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I was protecting him,’ Sam whispers.</span>
<a name="l8139"><span class="ln">8139 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You like the power you get from hurting people.</span>
<a name="l8140"><span class="ln">8140 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re just like your father.’ Sam can’t speak.</span>
<a name="l8141"><span class="ln">8141 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s not him.</span>
<a name="l8142"><span class="ln">8142 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s never him.</span>
<a name="l8143"><span class="ln">8143 </span></a><span class="s0">Trying to keep himself here.</span>
<a name="l8144"><span class="ln">8144 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t talk about Avery like that,’ he whispers.</span>
<a name="l8145"><span class="ln">8145 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like she doesn’t hear him.</span>
<a name="l8146"><span class="ln">8146 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen says, voice suddenly crisp.</span>
<a name="l8147"><span class="ln">8147 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Are you coming inside?</span>
<a name="l8148"><span class="ln">8148 </span></a><span class="s0">You can sit down while I call you in.</span>
<a name="l8149"><span class="ln">8149 </span></a><span class="s0">You know you deserve it, Sammy Lou.’ A cute name.</span>
<a name="l8150"><span class="ln">8150 </span></a><span class="s0">Just Sammy Lou.</span>
<a name="l8151"><span class="ln">8151 </span></a><span class="s0">Does he deserve it?</span>
<a name="l8152"><span class="ln">8152 </span></a><span class="s0">you do you do you do you do He turns.</span>
<a name="l8153"><span class="ln">8153 </span></a><span class="s0">He walks away.</span>
<a name="l8154"><span class="ln">8154 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I thought so,’ Aunt Karen calls.</span>
<a name="l8155"><span class="ln">8155 </span></a><span class="s0">Her shoulders stay stiff.</span>
<a name="l8156"><span class="ln">8156 </span></a><span class="s0">Her face sets.</span>
<a name="l8157"><span class="ln">8157 </span></a><span class="s0">Or broken bones.</span>
<a name="l8158"><span class="ln">8158 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s having a rough life.</span>
<a name="l8159"><span class="ln">8159 </span></a><span class="s0">High school sucks.</span>
<a name="l8160"><span class="ln">8160 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s aware of how different he is now.</span>
<a name="l8161"><span class="ln">8161 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s stupid, wanting friends.</span>
<a name="l8162"><span class="ln">8162 </span></a><span class="s0">But Sammy understands.</span>
<a name="l8163"><span class="ln">8163 </span></a><span class="s0">He wouldn’t mind a friend.</span>
<a name="l8164"><span class="ln">8164 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s worried school will kill Avery.</span>
<a name="l8165"><span class="ln">8165 </span></a><span class="s0">But he can fix this, right?</span>
<a name="l8166"><span class="ln">8166 </span></a><span class="s0">He fixes everything.</span>
<a name="l8167"><span class="ln">8167 </span></a><span class="s0">He scales it like Spiderman.</span>
<a name="l8168"><span class="ln">8168 </span></a><span class="s0">Hand over hand, propelled by momentum and sheer will.</span>
<a name="l8169"><span class="ln">8169 </span></a><span class="s0">But he’s up.</span>
<a name="l8170"><span class="ln">8170 </span></a><span class="s0">A happy shout.</span>
<a name="l8171"><span class="ln">8171 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery pulls his hood off.</span>
<a name="l8172"><span class="ln">8172 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll catch the moon and steal it.</span>
<a name="l8173"><span class="ln">8173 </span></a><span class="s0">Are you coming?’ Avery is coming.</span>
<a name="l8174"><span class="ln">8174 </span></a><span class="s0">Note to self: stop babying him already.</span>
<a name="l8175"><span class="ln">8175 </span></a><span class="s0">But it’s fine.</span>
<a name="l8176"><span class="ln">8176 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s just happy.</span>
<a name="l8177"><span class="ln">8177 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy can breathe again.</span>
<a name="l8178"><span class="ln">8178 </span></a><span class="s0">And it’s good.</span>
<a name="l8179"><span class="ln">8179 </span></a><span class="s0">Everything is good.</span>
<a name="l8180"><span class="ln">8180 </span></a><span class="s0">He jumps again and again.</span>
<a name="l8181"><span class="ln">8181 </span></a><span class="s0">And he can take what he wants.</span>
<a name="l8182"><span class="ln">8182 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Get down right now.</span>
<a name="l8183"><span class="ln">8183 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy!’ Get down and get your ears slapped, she means.</span>
<a name="l8184"><span class="ln">8184 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy nudges Avery with his elbow.</span>
<a name="l8185"><span class="ln">8185 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Together?’ ‘You,’ Avery whispers, ‘and me.</span>
<a name="l8186"><span class="ln">8186 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen hollers at them.</span>
<a name="l8187"><span class="ln">8187 </span></a><span class="s0">They smack together as they tumble through the split.</span>
<a name="l8188"><span class="ln">8188 </span></a><span class="s0">They tangle for a second in the uncut lawn.</span>
<a name="l8189"><span class="ln">8189 </span></a><span class="s0">The trampoline waves torn threads in apology.</span>
<a name="l8190"><span class="ln">8190 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Anything broken?’ Sammy says.</span>
<a name="l8191"><span class="ln">8191 </span></a><span class="s0">She’ll lock them out.</span>
<a name="l8192"><span class="ln">8192 </span></a><span class="s0">But so what?</span>
<a name="l8193"><span class="ln">8193 </span></a><span class="s0">He throws his arm over Avery’s shoulder.</span>
<a name="l8194"><span class="ln">8194 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re height for height right now.</span>
<a name="l8195"><span class="ln">8195 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We are the kings of nowhere,’ Sammy says.</span>
<a name="l8196"><span class="ln">8196 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We only need us.’ He’s a very good liar.</span>
<a name="l8197"><span class="ln">8197 </span></a><span class="s0">The wallet is hot and heavy in Sam’s sweat-slick hands.</span>
<a name="l8198"><span class="ln">8198 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam has a headache.</span>
<a name="l8199"><span class="ln">8199 </span></a><span class="s0">From sun beating on his bare head?</span>
<a name="l8200"><span class="ln">8200 </span></a><span class="s0">From sleeping on the ground?</span>
<a name="l8201"><span class="ln">8201 </span></a><span class="s0">Except he doesn’t want to.</span>
<a name="l8202"><span class="ln">8202 </span></a><span class="s0">He just doesn’t care any more.</span>
<a name="l8203"><span class="ln">8203 </span></a><span class="s0">Seaglass necklaces and hand-painted bowls and boxes of postcards.</span>
<a name="l8204"><span class="ln">8204 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That’s ten for two, boy,’ the old woman says.</span>
<a name="l8205"><span class="ln">8205 </span></a><span class="s0">Three times what she asked for.</span>
<a name="l8206"><span class="ln">8206 </span></a><span class="s0">But they’re making him sick.</span>
<a name="l8207"><span class="ln">8207 </span></a><span class="s0">‘This OK?’ he says.</span>
<a name="l8208"><span class="ln">8208 </span></a><span class="s0">The first person to smile at him in days.</span>
<a name="l8209"><span class="ln">8209 </span></a><span class="s0">When is he going to understand that it’s over?</span>
<a name="l8210"><span class="ln">8210 </span></a><span class="s0">She slammed the door in his face.</span>
<a name="l8211"><span class="ln">8211 </span></a><span class="s0">What’s it going to take for him to stop?</span>
<a name="l8212"><span class="ln">8212 </span></a><span class="s0">The police to show up?</span>
<a name="l8213"><span class="ln">8213 </span></a><span class="s0">He should turn a few days into for ever days.</span>
<a name="l8214"><span class="ln">8214 </span></a><span class="s0">Do everyone a favour.</span>
<a name="l8215"><span class="ln">8215 </span></a><span class="s0">Come on, cut the self-loathing.</span>
<a name="l8216"><span class="ln">8216 </span></a><span class="s0">The scrolls of material fit nicely in two hands.</span>
<a name="l8217"><span class="ln">8217 </span></a><span class="s0">Pity he’s soaking them with sweat.</span>
<a name="l8218"><span class="ln">8218 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs to get himself together.</span>
<a name="l8219"><span class="ln">8219 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s an embarrassment.</span>
<a name="l8220"><span class="ln">8220 </span></a><span class="s0">Feet patter inside.</span>
<a name="l8221"><span class="ln">8221 </span></a><span class="s0">The doorhandles twist and then pauses.</span>
<a name="l8222"><span class="ln">8222 </span></a><span class="s0">She knows it’s him, doesn’t she?</span>
<a name="l8223"><span class="ln">8223 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh my God.’ Her voice is flat.</span>
<a name="l8224"><span class="ln">8224 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Because you, um, s-sew,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l8225"><span class="ln">8225 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Were you actually living upstairs like a creepy psycho?</span>
<a name="l8226"><span class="ln">8226 </span></a><span class="s0">Like … why?</span>
<a name="l8227"><span class="ln">8227 </span></a><span class="s0">I had nowhere to go, he wants to say.</span>
<a name="l8228"><span class="ln">8228 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m the boy of nothing and nowhere.</span>
<a name="l8229"><span class="ln">8229 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I checked with all my brothers.’ Moxie’s eyes narrows.</span>
<a name="l8230"><span class="ln">8230 </span></a><span class="s0">‘None of them knows you.</span>
<a name="l8231"><span class="ln">8231 </span></a><span class="s0">But that’s it.</span>
<a name="l8232"><span class="ln">8232 </span></a><span class="s0">She slams the door.</span>
<a name="l8233"><span class="ln">8233 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam leaves without another word.</span>
<a name="l8234"><span class="ln">8234 </span></a><span class="s0">The front door is open again.</span>
<a name="l8235"><span class="ln">8235 </span></a><span class="s0">She doesn’t call out after him.</span>
<a name="l8236"><span class="ln">8236 </span></a><span class="s0">But he notices the material is tucked under her arm.</span>
<a name="l8237"><span class="ln">8237 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh, boyfriend?’ the florist says.</span>
<a name="l8238"><span class="ln">8238 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I mean, she’s not my girlfriend.</span>
<a name="l8239"><span class="ln">8239 </span></a><span class="s0">The florist looks at him.</span>
<a name="l8240"><span class="ln">8240 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s scraping together twenty-cent pieces until he lifts another wallet.</span>
<a name="l8241"><span class="ln">8241 </span></a><span class="s0">Well, she’ll most likely do that anyway.</span>
<a name="l8242"><span class="ln">8242 </span></a><span class="s0">Why is he doing this?</span>
<a name="l8243"><span class="ln">8243 </span></a><span class="s0">This is all wrong.</span>
<a name="l8244"><span class="ln">8244 </span></a><span class="s0">The sympathetic look in her eyes startles him.</span>
<a name="l8245"><span class="ln">8245 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How mad are we talking?’ the florist says.</span>
<a name="l8246"><span class="ln">8246 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Because flowers send a message, you know.</span>
<a name="l8247"><span class="ln">8247 </span></a><span class="s0">He should’ve lifted another wallet.</span>
<a name="l8248"><span class="ln">8248 </span></a><span class="s0">Destroying more than fixing.</span>
<a name="l8249"><span class="ln">8249 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam left alone.</span>
<a name="l8250"><span class="ln">8250 </span></a><span class="s0">Yeah, OK, stop.</span>
<a name="l8251"><span class="ln">8251 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well.’ Sam shakes the hair out of his eyes.</span>
<a name="l8252"><span class="ln">8252 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Which I’m not,’ Sam adds, quickly, looking up.</span>
<a name="l8253"><span class="ln">8253 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m not a creeper.</span>
<a name="l8254"><span class="ln">8254 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ouch.’ The florist taps her manicured fingernails on the countertop.</span>
<a name="l8255"><span class="ln">8255 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I just want to say sorry.</span>
<a name="l8256"><span class="ln">8256 </span></a><span class="s0">I don’t …’ He swallows.</span>
<a name="l8257"><span class="ln">8257 </span></a><span class="s0">She folds her arms, surveying them.</span>
<a name="l8258"><span class="ln">8258 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam trails after her.</span>
<a name="l8259"><span class="ln">8259 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Chivalry is not dead!</span>
<a name="l8260"><span class="ln">8260 </span></a><span class="s0">And you’re kind of adorable.</span>
<a name="l8261"><span class="ln">8261 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Follow.’ He does.</span>
<a name="l8262"><span class="ln">8262 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I only have five dollars,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l8263"><span class="ln">8263 </span></a><span class="s0">The florist smiles.</span>
<a name="l8264"><span class="ln">8264 </span></a><span class="s0">He tried to take the florist’s advice.</span>
<a name="l8265"><span class="ln">8265 </span></a><span class="s0">He really tried.</span>
<a name="l8266"><span class="ln">8266 </span></a><span class="s0">But at least his tangles have been tamed?</span>
<a name="l8267"><span class="ln">8267 </span></a><span class="s0">And … a lot of glitter resurfaced.</span>
<a name="l8268"><span class="ln">8268 </span></a><span class="s0">Consequently he has the worst sunburn over his pale shoulders.</span>
<a name="l8269"><span class="ln">8269 </span></a><span class="s0">But he did an OK job, right?</span>
<a name="l8270"><span class="ln">8270 </span></a><span class="s0">That will not help.</span>
<a name="l8271"><span class="ln">8271 </span></a><span class="s0">Deep in the house, a baby wails.</span>
<a name="l8272"><span class="ln">8272 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe she didn’t hear?</span>
<a name="l8273"><span class="ln">8273 </span></a><span class="s0">Her frown intensifies.</span>
<a name="l8274"><span class="ln">8274 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l8275"><span class="ln">8275 </span></a><span class="s0">Possibly proof his intentions are honourable.</span>
<a name="l8276"><span class="ln">8276 </span></a><span class="s0">Possibly a shield.</span>
<a name="l8277"><span class="ln">8277 </span></a><span class="s0">Stand up straight.</span>
<a name="l8278"><span class="ln">8278 </span></a><span class="s0">Look her in the eye.</span>
<a name="l8279"><span class="ln">8279 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t lose it.</span>
<a name="l8280"><span class="ln">8280 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I just want to say sorry,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l8281"><span class="ln">8281 </span></a><span class="s0">Which is exactly what he is.</span>
<a name="l8282"><span class="ln">8282 </span></a><span class="s0">He falls off with a shriek of laughter.</span>
<a name="l8283"><span class="ln">8283 </span></a><span class="s0">She hasn’t slammed the door.</span>
<a name="l8284"><span class="ln">8284 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s maybe got five seconds.</span>
<a name="l8285"><span class="ln">8285 </span></a><span class="s0">‘When you were away.</span>
<a name="l8286"><span class="ln">8286 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You all thought I was someone else’s friend.</span>
<a name="l8287"><span class="ln">8287 </span></a><span class="s0">So I stayed.</span>
<a name="l8288"><span class="ln">8288 </span></a><span class="s0">I swear it was an accident.’ Moxie’s scowl remains.</span>
<a name="l8289"><span class="ln">8289 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You lost me there.’ Moxie gestures to her shirt.</span>
<a name="l8290"><span class="ln">8290 </span></a><span class="s0">Gingerly, Sam offers the box of chocolates.</span>
<a name="l8291"><span class="ln">8291 </span></a><span class="s0">She takes the box.</span>
<a name="l8292"><span class="ln">8292 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And you’re not forgiven.’ But she took the chocolates.</span>
<a name="l8293"><span class="ln">8293 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s heart dares to beat again.</span>
<a name="l8294"><span class="ln">8294 </span></a><span class="s0">She looks curious.</span>
<a name="l8295"><span class="ln">8295 </span></a><span class="s0">She plucks a chocolate and bites.</span>
<a name="l8296"><span class="ln">8296 </span></a><span class="s0">Then flush out the pool.</span>
<a name="l8297"><span class="ln">8297 </span></a><span class="s0">Then fill it.</span>
<a name="l8298"><span class="ln">8298 </span></a><span class="s0">The hose is pointing at Sam.</span>
<a name="l8299"><span class="ln">8299 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam gets a faceful of water.</span>
<a name="l8300"><span class="ln">8300 </span></a><span class="s0">Laughing is good, right?</span>
<a name="l8301"><span class="ln">8301 </span></a><span class="s0">Because it seems she’s accepted the apology.</span>
<a name="l8302"><span class="ln">8302 </span></a><span class="s0">‘So you’re homeless,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l8303"><span class="ln">8303 </span></a><span class="s0">Not like a question.</span>
<a name="l8304"><span class="ln">8304 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s caramel gets suddenly stuck in his throat.</span>
<a name="l8305"><span class="ln">8305 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Not around,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l8306"><span class="ln">8306 </span></a><span class="s0">I just – I make do.’ ‘In my house, clearly.</span>
<a name="l8307"><span class="ln">8307 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No.’ Moxie looks away again.</span>
<a name="l8308"><span class="ln">8308 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It was … it was my mum’s space.</span>
<a name="l8309"><span class="ln">8309 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s said the wrong thing.</span>
<a name="l8310"><span class="ln">8310 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No, my mum died.’ Moxie’s voice is strangely emotionless.</span>
<a name="l8311"><span class="ln">8311 </span></a><span class="s0">She … she had it after Dash was born too.</span>
<a name="l8312"><span class="ln">8312 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s why there’s like seven years between Dash and Toby.</span>
<a name="l8313"><span class="ln">8313 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie doesn’t seem fazed.</span>
<a name="l8314"><span class="ln">8314 </span></a><span class="s0">But he doesn’t have conversational skills.</span>
<a name="l8315"><span class="ln">8315 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s … that’s exactly what it feels like.</span>
<a name="l8316"><span class="ln">8316 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Met properly,’ Moxie concedes.</span>
<a name="l8317"><span class="ln">8317 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie looks pointedly at his arms.</span>
<a name="l8318"><span class="ln">8318 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I didn’t tell anyone that either.</span>
<a name="l8319"><span class="ln">8319 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I have to tell my dad the truth.</span>
<a name="l8320"><span class="ln">8320 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll go.’ He knows this is the end.</span>
<a name="l8321"><span class="ln">8321 </span></a><span class="s0">Walking to nowhere.</span>
<a name="l8322"><span class="ln">8322 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Wait.’ Moxie stands too.</span>
<a name="l8323"><span class="ln">8323 </span></a><span class="s0">‘My dad could help you.</span>
<a name="l8324"><span class="ln">8324 </span></a><span class="s0">And there’s other stuff.</span>
<a name="l8325"><span class="ln">8325 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can’t go to prison.</span>
<a name="l8326"><span class="ln">8326 </span></a><span class="s0">I just can’t.</span>
<a name="l8327"><span class="ln">8327 </span></a><span class="s0">He’d never cope.</span>
<a name="l8328"><span class="ln">8328 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie chews her lip, her face strangely vulnerable.</span>
<a name="l8329"><span class="ln">8329 </span></a><span class="s0">I get it.’ There’s silence.</span>
<a name="l8330"><span class="ln">8330 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can’t cook,’ Moxie says, very suddenly.</span>
<a name="l8331"><span class="ln">8331 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I burn everything.</span>
<a name="l8332"><span class="ln">8332 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s a literal nightmare.’ Sam remembers scrubbing the blackened pot.</span>
<a name="l8333"><span class="ln">8333 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Do you know how to make pancakes?’ she says.</span>
<a name="l8334"><span class="ln">8334 </span></a><span class="s0">He also pretends he’s not watching Moxie.</span>
<a name="l8335"><span class="ln">8335 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie takes this in with thin lips.</span>
<a name="l8336"><span class="ln">8336 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You don’t seem like an axe murderer,’ she says finally.</span>
<a name="l8337"><span class="ln">8337 </span></a><span class="s0">And you were OK-ish that Sunday.’ ‘OK-ish?’ Sam repeats.</span>
<a name="l8338"><span class="ln">8338 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oops.’ He turns huge brown eyes up at Sam.</span>
<a name="l8339"><span class="ln">8339 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie has a very satisfied look on her face.</span>
<a name="l8340"><span class="ln">8340 </span></a><span class="s0">He flips pancakes.</span>
<a name="l8341"><span class="ln">8341 </span></a><span class="s0">And Sam makes a fine pancake.</span>
<a name="l8342"><span class="ln">8342 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re crisp around the edges and perfectly cooked inside.</span>
<a name="l8343"><span class="ln">8343 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie tears a pancake in half.</span>
<a name="l8344"><span class="ln">8344 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I know you excel at dishes, so have at it.</span>
<a name="l8345"><span class="ln">8345 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No!’ Moxie eyeballs him.</span>
<a name="l8346"><span class="ln">8346 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh yes, sir.</span>
<a name="l8347"><span class="ln">8347 </span></a><span class="s0">He does feel bad for her.</span>
<a name="l8348"><span class="ln">8348 </span></a><span class="s0">He obviously has the easier job here.</span>
<a name="l8349"><span class="ln">8349 </span></a><span class="s0">For an easy grab and run.</span>
<a name="l8350"><span class="ln">8350 </span></a><span class="s0">Absolutely pitiful, Sam.</span>
<a name="l8351"><span class="ln">8351 </span></a><span class="s0">Scared of leaving.</span>
<a name="l8352"><span class="ln">8352 </span></a><span class="s0">His leg bounces.</span>
<a name="l8353"><span class="ln">8353 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so close to Moxie and she smells of marmalade.</span>
<a name="l8354"><span class="ln">8354 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You made this?’ he says.</span>
<a name="l8355"><span class="ln">8355 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie stretches her shirt out a little to admire it.</span>
<a name="l8356"><span class="ln">8356 </span></a><span class="s0">He never wants to go.</span>
<a name="l8357"><span class="ln">8357 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s smile is sheepish.</span>
<a name="l8358"><span class="ln">8358 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t focus.</span>
<a name="l8359"><span class="ln">8359 </span></a><span class="s0">Sits beside him.</span>
<a name="l8360"><span class="ln">8360 </span></a><span class="s0">And she knows who and what he is.</span>
<a name="l8361"><span class="ln">8361 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No, you missed it.</span>
<a name="l8362"><span class="ln">8362 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie’s body relaxes and her shoulder leans against his.</span>
<a name="l8363"><span class="ln">8363 </span></a><span class="s0">The pressure is warm and soft and everything.</span>
<a name="l8364"><span class="ln">8364 </span></a><span class="s0">And he falls into it.</span>
<a name="l8365"><span class="ln">8365 </span></a><span class="s0">Just a little.</span>
<a name="l8366"><span class="ln">8366 </span></a><span class="s0">But for the barest moment between patchwork frowns, he’s wanted.</span>
<a name="l8367"><span class="ln">8367 </span></a><span class="s0">He falls asleep.</span>
<a name="l8368"><span class="ln">8368 </span></a><span class="s0">How could he?</span>
<a name="l8369"><span class="ln">8369 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam snaps awake so fast that he swallows his heart.</span>
<a name="l8370"><span class="ln">8370 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie is gone.</span>
<a name="l8371"><span class="ln">8371 </span></a><span class="s0">And the house is anything but quiet.</span>
<a name="l8372"><span class="ln">8372 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dad said we’d knock off at three.</span>
<a name="l8373"><span class="ln">8373 </span></a><span class="s0">LANGUAGE.’ Sam is suffocating.</span>
<a name="l8374"><span class="ln">8374 </span></a><span class="s0">But this time he has nowhere to hide.</span>
<a name="l8375"><span class="ln">8375 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Jack perpetually smells like a sewer.</span>
<a name="l8376"><span class="ln">8376 </span></a><span class="s0">I was cutting timber with Dad.</span>
<a name="l8377"><span class="ln">8377 </span></a><span class="s0">Directly on to Sam.</span>
<a name="l8378"><span class="ln">8378 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam catches it with his face.</span>
<a name="l8379"><span class="ln">8379 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh,’ says Jack, backtracking to stare.</span>
<a name="l8380"><span class="ln">8380 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to run.</span>
<a name="l8381"><span class="ln">8381 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to run right now.</span>
<a name="l8382"><span class="ln">8382 </span></a><span class="s0">‘My friend Sam is staying for dinner,’ she announces.</span>
<a name="l8383"><span class="ln">8383 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And isn’t it Jack’s night to cook?</span>
<a name="l8384"><span class="ln">8384 </span></a><span class="s0">He narrows his eyes at Moxie.</span>
<a name="l8385"><span class="ln">8385 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Language.’ ‘Sorry.’ Moxie raises her hands innocently.</span>
<a name="l8386"><span class="ln">8386 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m overworked and underpaid,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l8387"><span class="ln">8387 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie waves vaguely at the room.</span>
<a name="l8388"><span class="ln">8388 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Wait, he’s your friend?</span>
<a name="l8389"><span class="ln">8389 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hmm, oops.’ Considering his recent decisions, she’s not wrong.</span>
<a name="l8390"><span class="ln">8390 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Let’s worry about that later.</span>
<a name="l8391"><span class="ln">8391 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You look tired, Sam.</span>
<a name="l8392"><span class="ln">8392 </span></a><span class="s0">But not on the topic she has in mind.</span>
<a name="l8393"><span class="ln">8393 </span></a><span class="s0">A dress dummy displays a pinned outfit of emerald green.</span>
<a name="l8394"><span class="ln">8394 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie’s smile is wry.</span>
<a name="l8395"><span class="ln">8395 </span></a><span class="s0">Dinner is loud and messy and intoxicatingly alive.</span>
<a name="l8396"><span class="ln">8396 </span></a><span class="s0">Also because he’s far away from Mr De Lainey.</span>
<a name="l8397"><span class="ln">8397 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam just … he can’t with adults.</span>
<a name="l8398"><span class="ln">8398 </span></a><span class="s0">They frown, they shout, they hit.</span>
<a name="l8399"><span class="ln">8399 </span></a><span class="s0">Just in case.</span>
<a name="l8400"><span class="ln">8400 </span></a><span class="s0">The baby faceplants in a bowl of sauce.</span>
<a name="l8401"><span class="ln">8401 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie pokes Sam’s leg under the table.</span>
<a name="l8402"><span class="ln">8402 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He’s the softest squish you’ll ever meet.</span>
<a name="l8403"><span class="ln">8403 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam shovels in food to hide the smile.</span>
<a name="l8404"><span class="ln">8404 </span></a><span class="s0">‘So, Moxie.’ Mr De Lainey clears his throat.</span>
<a name="l8405"><span class="ln">8405 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re taking my weekend now?’ Her father sighs.</span>
<a name="l8406"><span class="ln">8406 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Moxie …’ ‘Oh, it’s fine.’ Moxie’s teeth clench.</span>
<a name="l8407"><span class="ln">8407 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie snatches her fork and stabs a meatball.</span>
<a name="l8408"><span class="ln">8408 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No,’ Moxie snaps.</span>
<a name="l8409"><span class="ln">8409 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No and no.’ The baby’s lip juts out.</span>
<a name="l8410"><span class="ln">8410 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Seriously, Moxie?’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l8411"><span class="ln">8411 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You never have to look after them.</span>
<a name="l8412"><span class="ln">8412 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m only fifteen.</span>
<a name="l8413"><span class="ln">8413 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m a kid too.</span>
<a name="l8414"><span class="ln">8414 </span></a><span class="s0">‘All right, let’s calm down,’ Mr De Lainey says.</span>
<a name="l8415"><span class="ln">8415 </span></a><span class="s0">No one listens.</span>
<a name="l8416"><span class="ln">8416 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I never get to stop,’ Moxie shoots back.</span>
<a name="l8417"><span class="ln">8417 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Who got up for the baby last night?</span>
<a name="l8418"><span class="ln">8418 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Who’s been up since five with Toby?</span>
<a name="l8419"><span class="ln">8419 </span></a><span class="s0">But in that moment, his heart tugs for Moxie.</span>
<a name="l8420"><span class="ln">8420 </span></a><span class="s0">He gets it.</span>
<a name="l8421"><span class="ln">8421 </span></a><span class="s0">A life tangled with siblings who can’t look after themselves?</span>
<a name="l8422"><span class="ln">8422 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam gets it.</span>
<a name="l8423"><span class="ln">8423 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We all miss Mum,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l8424"><span class="ln">8424 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Grady,’ Mr De Lainey calls, sounding a little desperate.</span>
<a name="l8425"><span class="ln">8425 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey, just wait a —’ The front door bangs.</span>
<a name="l8426"><span class="ln">8426 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr De Lainey puts his head in his hands.</span>
<a name="l8427"><span class="ln">8427 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack snaps garlic bread in half.</span>
<a name="l8428"><span class="ln">8428 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Come on.’ It’s a command.</span>
<a name="l8429"><span class="ln">8429 </span></a><span class="s0">They sweep upstairs and leave the clatter of crying below.</span>
<a name="l8430"><span class="ln">8430 </span></a><span class="s0">But she doesn’t.</span>
<a name="l8431"><span class="ln">8431 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ve seen worse,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l8432"><span class="ln">8432 </span></a><span class="s0">He should not have said anything.</span>
<a name="l8433"><span class="ln">8433 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Long time ago.’ ‘OK, wow.</span>
<a name="l8434"><span class="ln">8434 </span></a><span class="s0">I am such a jerk.’ ‘No …’ Sam’s heart thuds.</span>
<a name="l8435"><span class="ln">8435 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s – you’re allowed to hurt.</span>
<a name="l8436"><span class="ln">8436 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I really miss my mum,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l8437"><span class="ln">8437 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam looks out the window at the darkening sky.</span>
<a name="l8438"><span class="ln">8438 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I should go.’ Sam doesn’t move.</span>
<a name="l8439"><span class="ln">8439 </span></a><span class="s0">He thinks of the school.</span>
<a name="l8440"><span class="ln">8440 </span></a><span class="s0">He’d give anything to stay like this.</span>
<a name="l8441"><span class="ln">8441 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Just sleep in the office again,’ she says finally.</span>
<a name="l8442"><span class="ln">8442 </span></a><span class="s0">She presents fingers of glitter in proof.</span>
<a name="l8443"><span class="ln">8443 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t do this.</span>
<a name="l8444"><span class="ln">8444 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t know how.</span>
<a name="l8445"><span class="ln">8445 </span></a><span class="s0">Shouts and voices have dimmed as kids load into buses.</span>
<a name="l8446"><span class="ln">8446 </span></a><span class="s0">His shirt is inside out, collar popped, tags fluttering.</span>
<a name="l8447"><span class="ln">8447 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks happy.</span>
<a name="l8448"><span class="ln">8448 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy stares at him.</span>
<a name="l8449"><span class="ln">8449 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I kissed Elle,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l8450"><span class="ln">8450 </span></a><span class="s0">Stop.’ Sammy pulls the paper out of his nose.</span>
<a name="l8451"><span class="ln">8451 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re talking way too fast.’ Not just talking.</span>
<a name="l8452"><span class="ln">8452 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s going way too fast for Sammy to keep up.</span>
<a name="l8453"><span class="ln">8453 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s going too fast.</span>
<a name="l8454"><span class="ln">8454 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not like them.</span>
<a name="l8455"><span class="ln">8455 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s going to get hurt.</span>
<a name="l8456"><span class="ln">8456 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You can’t go around kissing.</span>
<a name="l8457"><span class="ln">8457 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy tries to steady himself.</span>
<a name="l8458"><span class="ln">8458 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not ready for this kind of conversation with Avery.</span>
<a name="l8459"><span class="ln">8459 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Because,’ he says, closing his eyes, ‘they’re messing with you.</span>
<a name="l8460"><span class="ln">8460 </span></a><span class="s0">To hurt you.’ Avery frowns.</span>
<a name="l8461"><span class="ln">8461 </span></a><span class="s0">Isn’t that nice for him?</span>
<a name="l8462"><span class="ln">8462 </span></a><span class="s0">His bottom lip juts out and he looks wounded.</span>
<a name="l8463"><span class="ln">8463 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I could earn money, right?</span>
<a name="l8464"><span class="ln">8464 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy has the dull feeling that he’s being manipulated.</span>
<a name="l8465"><span class="ln">8465 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Did you say you’re going with them now?’ Sammy says.</span>
<a name="l8466"><span class="ln">8466 </span></a><span class="s0">Not the kind of people Sammy wants Avery around.</span>
<a name="l8467"><span class="ln">8467 </span></a><span class="s0">All crass jokes and cold smirks.</span>
<a name="l8468"><span class="ln">8468 </span></a><span class="s0">Does Sammy want Avery around anyone?</span>
<a name="l8469"><span class="ln">8469 </span></a><span class="s0">He picks friends badly.</span>
<a name="l8470"><span class="ln">8470 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re not going to anyone’s house,’ Sammy says.</span>
<a name="l8471"><span class="ln">8471 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’re going back to Aunt Karen’s.’ Avery’s eyes narrow.</span>
<a name="l8472"><span class="ln">8472 </span></a><span class="s0">How’s Sam supposed to explain?</span>
<a name="l8473"><span class="ln">8473 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t know how to let go of Avery.</span>
<a name="l8474"><span class="ln">8474 </span></a><span class="s0">Doesn’t think it’s the right time.</span>
<a name="l8475"><span class="ln">8475 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You can’t have both.</span>
<a name="l8476"><span class="ln">8476 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like being a kid versus growing up.</span>
<a name="l8477"><span class="ln">8477 </span></a><span class="s0">A reason amongst millions that he’s not ready for this.</span>
<a name="l8478"><span class="ln">8478 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery pulls the toy car out of his pocket.</span>
<a name="l8479"><span class="ln">8479 </span></a><span class="s0">He flips it over with long thin fingers, staring.</span>
<a name="l8480"><span class="ln">8480 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy tests his nose.</span>
<a name="l8481"><span class="ln">8481 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery bounces to his feet.</span>
<a name="l8482"><span class="ln">8482 </span></a><span class="s0">One waves him over.</span>
<a name="l8483"><span class="ln">8483 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s fingers close over the toy car.</span>
<a name="l8484"><span class="ln">8484 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Please, just listen.</span>
<a name="l8485"><span class="ln">8485 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I mean,’ Sammy says, teeth grating, ‘under your clothes.</span>
<a name="l8486"><span class="ln">8486 </span></a><span class="s0">If clothes cover it, you can’t touch it.</span>
<a name="l8487"><span class="ln">8487 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s the rule, OK?</span>
<a name="l8488"><span class="ln">8488 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You hit people.</span>
<a name="l8489"><span class="ln">8489 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s worse than anything West does.</span>
<a name="l8490"><span class="ln">8490 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s bad, Sammy.</span>
<a name="l8491"><span class="ln">8491 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s so so bad.’ Sammy’s teeth clench.</span>
<a name="l8492"><span class="ln">8492 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I didn’t hit anyone.</span>
<a name="l8493"><span class="ln">8493 </span></a><span class="s0">I promised I’d stop, didn’t I?</span>
<a name="l8494"><span class="ln">8494 </span></a><span class="s0">They jumped me.’ Avery flicks his fingers by his ear.</span>
<a name="l8495"><span class="ln">8495 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t belong to just you.</span>
<a name="l8496"><span class="ln">8496 </span></a><span class="s0">His smile is puppy-dog wide.</span>
<a name="l8497"><span class="ln">8497 </span></a><span class="s0">Innocent and anxiously excited.</span>
<a name="l8498"><span class="ln">8498 </span></a><span class="s0">West drapes an arm over his shoulder.</span>
<a name="l8499"><span class="ln">8499 </span></a><span class="s0">Laughs at him.</span>
<a name="l8500"><span class="ln">8500 </span></a><span class="s0">Or with him?</span>
<a name="l8501"><span class="ln">8501 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy looks down at the toy car in his hand.</span>
<a name="l8502"><span class="ln">8502 </span></a><span class="s0">A tear hits it, hot and wet.</span>
<a name="l8503"><span class="ln">8503 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s stupid to be crying.</span>
<a name="l8504"><span class="ln">8504 </span></a><span class="s0">Their routine becomes pleasantly seamless after a week.</span>
<a name="l8505"><span class="ln">8505 </span></a><span class="s0">They come out faster the more he’s around Moxie.</span>
<a name="l8506"><span class="ln">8506 </span></a><span class="s0">Wow, he actually has opinions.</span>
<a name="l8507"><span class="ln">8507 </span></a><span class="s0">This could be you.’ Sam looks up, alarmed.</span>
<a name="l8508"><span class="ln">8508 </span></a><span class="s0">You’d need to cut your hair though.</span>
<a name="l8509"><span class="ln">8509 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But do you actually like it long?</span>
<a name="l8510"><span class="ln">8510 </span></a><span class="s0">Because you could just get it tidied.</span>
<a name="l8511"><span class="ln">8511 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s a sticky mess.</span>
<a name="l8512"><span class="ln">8512 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll cut it.’ There’s a dangerous spark in her eyes.</span>
<a name="l8513"><span class="ln">8513 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam is decidedly nervous.</span>
<a name="l8514"><span class="ln">8514 </span></a><span class="s0">And he doesn’t want to see disgust in her eyes.</span>
<a name="l8515"><span class="ln">8515 </span></a><span class="s0">She ruffles fingers through his hair.</span>
<a name="l8516"><span class="ln">8516 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And what cities have you felled today?</span>
<a name="l8517"><span class="ln">8517 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re next, Jack.</span>
<a name="l8518"><span class="ln">8518 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He’s going to get the shower first,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l8519"><span class="ln">8519 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy clambers through the gate.</span>
<a name="l8520"><span class="ln">8520 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re friends … right?</span>
<a name="l8521"><span class="ln">8521 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie snorts and waits till they’re gone before scooting closer.</span>
<a name="l8522"><span class="ln">8522 </span></a><span class="s0">Spiderwebs of sensations dart across his skull.</span>
<a name="l8523"><span class="ln">8523 </span></a><span class="s0">The scissors snip.</span>
<a name="l8524"><span class="ln">8524 </span></a><span class="s0">Wisps of corn silk strands drop on to Sam’s shoulders.</span>
<a name="l8525"><span class="ln">8525 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It would look so good on you.</span>
<a name="l8526"><span class="ln">8526 </span></a><span class="s0">But I’m …’ ‘Remarkably pretty.</span>
<a name="l8527"><span class="ln">8527 </span></a><span class="s0">She fluffs hair out from behind his ears.</span>
<a name="l8528"><span class="ln">8528 </span></a><span class="s0">Can she feel them burning hot?</span>
<a name="l8529"><span class="ln">8529 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie jerks back.</span>
<a name="l8530"><span class="ln">8530 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh no.’ Sam’s shoulders straighten.</span>
<a name="l8531"><span class="ln">8531 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What do you mean “oh no”?’ ‘Um.’ Panic hits.</span>
<a name="l8532"><span class="ln">8532 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Moxie.’ ‘OK, OK, don’t stress.</span>
<a name="l8533"><span class="ln">8533 </span></a><span class="s0">I just …’ There’s a tense pause.</span>
<a name="l8534"><span class="ln">8534 </span></a><span class="s0">‘JEREMY,’ she hollers.</span>
<a name="l8535"><span class="ln">8535 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What’s going on?</span>
<a name="l8536"><span class="ln">8536 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie.’ ‘I don’t understand,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l8537"><span class="ln">8537 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I watched three tutorials.’ ‘That is confusing,’ Jeremy says.</span>
<a name="l8538"><span class="ln">8538 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam drops his face in his hands.</span>
<a name="l8539"><span class="ln">8539 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s considerably less exhilarating.</span>
<a name="l8540"><span class="ln">8540 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Shorter at the sides and longer at the top.</span>
<a name="l8541"><span class="ln">8541 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s going to be bald.</span>
<a name="l8542"><span class="ln">8542 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You have a buzz cut,’ Sam says, voice thin.</span>
<a name="l8543"><span class="ln">8543 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie takes a bite of his sandwich.</span>
<a name="l8544"><span class="ln">8544 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l8545"><span class="ln">8545 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He donated it to cancer kids.</span>
<a name="l8546"><span class="ln">8546 </span></a><span class="s0">How long did it get, Jeremy?</span>
<a name="l8547"><span class="ln">8547 </span></a><span class="s0">And totally unfocused.</span>
<a name="l8548"><span class="ln">8548 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam resists covering his ears in hopes of protecting them.</span>
<a name="l8549"><span class="ln">8549 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You were majestic,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l8550"><span class="ln">8550 </span></a><span class="s0">A lot of hair.</span>
<a name="l8551"><span class="ln">8551 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Go find a mirror.’ ‘I don’t want to,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l8552"><span class="ln">8552 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s not too bad.</span>
<a name="l8553"><span class="ln">8553 </span></a><span class="s0">His head feels strangely naked and he can actually see.</span>
<a name="l8554"><span class="ln">8554 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well, wow, Jeremy!</span>
<a name="l8555"><span class="ln">8555 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he notices Jeremy’s looking at his ribs.</span>
<a name="l8556"><span class="ln">8556 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s nothing.’ Sam looks away.</span>
<a name="l8557"><span class="ln">8557 </span></a><span class="s0">‘The ribs, however.’ ‘Unacceptable,’ says Jeremy.</span>
<a name="l8558"><span class="ln">8558 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He’s staying for dinner right, Moxie?</span>
<a name="l8559"><span class="ln">8559 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But really, Sam.</span>
<a name="l8560"><span class="ln">8560 </span></a><span class="s0">Any time.’ Sunshine crackles back into his eyes.</span>
<a name="l8561"><span class="ln">8561 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m making brownies.’ He ducks back into the house.</span>
<a name="l8562"><span class="ln">8562 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Make it caramel!’ Moxie yells at his back.</span>
<a name="l8563"><span class="ln">8563 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That was fun.’ Sam itches his neck.</span>
<a name="l8564"><span class="ln">8564 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Not really, no.’ ‘And you have a whole face.</span>
<a name="l8565"><span class="ln">8565 </span></a><span class="s0">She musses his hair again, frowning as she arranges it.</span>
<a name="l8566"><span class="ln">8566 </span></a><span class="s0">She’s so close, her hands all through his hair.</span>
<a name="l8567"><span class="ln">8567 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I like your eyes,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l8568"><span class="ln">8568 </span></a><span class="s0">She has no idea, does she?</span>
<a name="l8569"><span class="ln">8569 </span></a><span class="s0">What she does to his heart.</span>
<a name="l8570"><span class="ln">8570 </span></a><span class="s0">Sympathy is not her strong point.</span>
<a name="l8571"><span class="ln">8571 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll check on him tomorrow.</span>
<a name="l8572"><span class="ln">8572 </span></a><span class="s0">Make sure he’s eating.</span>
<a name="l8573"><span class="ln">8573 </span></a><span class="s0">Make sure he’s not on the edge of a meltdown.</span>
<a name="l8574"><span class="ln">8574 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Mayfair,’ she crows.</span>
<a name="l8575"><span class="ln">8575 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey, don’t do that,’ Jeremy says, petting him tenderly.</span>
<a name="l8576"><span class="ln">8576 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Phone.’ Jack looks helplessly at Jeremy.</span>
<a name="l8577"><span class="ln">8577 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He started—’ His father snaps his fingers.</span>
<a name="l8578"><span class="ln">8578 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Soon,’ Moxie says fiercely.</span>
<a name="l8579"><span class="ln">8579 </span></a><span class="s0">His chest tugs.</span>
<a name="l8580"><span class="ln">8580 </span></a><span class="s0">Two weeks is a lot of lying.</span>
<a name="l8581"><span class="ln">8581 </span></a><span class="s0">‘OK, take it off,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l8582"><span class="ln">8582 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Half the time they just text me anyway.</span>
<a name="l8583"><span class="ln">8583 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like, expected.’ ‘Dad picks on me,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l8584"><span class="ln">8584 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie reappears with an armful of garments.</span>
<a name="l8585"><span class="ln">8585 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Who do I kill with this?’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l8586"><span class="ln">8586 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That’s an unpicker, you goat.</span>
<a name="l8587"><span class="ln">8587 </span></a><span class="s0">And these are second-hand clothes.</span>
<a name="l8588"><span class="ln">8588 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack makes an exasperated sound.</span>
<a name="l8589"><span class="ln">8589 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam swivels the small torture instrument.</span>
<a name="l8590"><span class="ln">8590 </span></a><span class="s0">It feels like a lock pick.</span>
<a name="l8591"><span class="ln">8591 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Since they’re all completely useless.’ ‘Excuse me,’ Jeremy says.</span>
<a name="l8592"><span class="ln">8592 </span></a><span class="s0">Last year, I think.’ ‘I rest my case,’ Moxie mutters.</span>
<a name="l8593"><span class="ln">8593 </span></a><span class="s0">Grady appears, rubbing his eyes until his glasses are askew.</span>
<a name="l8594"><span class="ln">8594 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What’d I miss?’ ‘Everything,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l8595"><span class="ln">8595 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Why don’t you just buy clothes?</span>
<a name="l8596"><span class="ln">8596 </span></a><span class="s0">Save time.’ Moxie slams her scissors down, nostrils flaring.</span>
<a name="l8597"><span class="ln">8597 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh, here we go,’ Jeremy says.</span>
<a name="l8598"><span class="ln">8598 </span></a><span class="s0">Grady slides on to the bench across from Sam.</span>
<a name="l8599"><span class="ln">8599 </span></a><span class="s0">‘This seems unfair,’ Jeremy comments.</span>
<a name="l8600"><span class="ln">8600 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You can’t even cook.’ Moxie’s frown is lemon.</span>
<a name="l8601"><span class="ln">8601 </span></a><span class="s0">I can heat up lasagne.</span>
<a name="l8602"><span class="ln">8602 </span></a><span class="s0">I look after the kids all the time now.</span>
<a name="l8603"><span class="ln">8603 </span></a><span class="s0">Then she writes Jack and gives him a one.</span>
<a name="l8604"><span class="ln">8604 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack throws his Monopoly money.</span>
<a name="l8605"><span class="ln">8605 </span></a><span class="s0">The pen hesitates.</span>
<a name="l8606"><span class="ln">8606 </span></a><span class="s0">Then Moxie gives him an eight.</span>

<a name="l8611"><span class="ln">8611 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie’s lemon frown is back.</span>
<a name="l8612"><span class="ln">8612 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Jack.’ Jack slams his hand against the wall.</span>
<a name="l8613"><span class="ln">8613 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Jack,’ the De Lainey father snaps.</span>
<a name="l8614"><span class="ln">8614 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he stomps upstairs.</span>
<a name="l8615"><span class="ln">8615 </span></a><span class="s0">He grins like a delighted Cheshire Cat.</span>
<a name="l8616"><span class="ln">8616 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy and Grady exchange smirks.</span>
<a name="l8617"><span class="ln">8617 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sam is a lovely shade of red,’ Grady says.</span>
<a name="l8618"><span class="ln">8618 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He’s sunburnt.’ She cuts a sideways glance at Sam.</span>
<a name="l8619"><span class="ln">8619 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants to whisper, do you have a crush?</span>
<a name="l8620"><span class="ln">8620 </span></a><span class="s0">But his tongue is stuck, his breathing shallow.</span>
<a name="l8621"><span class="ln">8621 </span></a><span class="s0">It’d be so much worse if she did.</span>

<a name="l8625"><span class="ln">8625 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s a mountain of a man, but flus don’t discriminate.</span>
<a name="l8626"><span class="ln">8626 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dad,’ she says, ‘we’re totally out of food.</span>
<a name="l8627"><span class="ln">8627 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie smiles at him, surprised and entirely pleased.</span>
<a name="l8628"><span class="ln">8628 </span></a><span class="s0">Drive me to the shops!’ Silence.</span>
<a name="l8629"><span class="ln">8629 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Jeremy cannot return your calls right now,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l8630"><span class="ln">8630 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie narrows her eyes.</span>
<a name="l8631"><span class="ln">8631 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Did he come home last night?</span>
<a name="l8632"><span class="ln">8632 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Right, he’s grounded.’ He sneezes.</span>
<a name="l8633"><span class="ln">8633 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie hands him the whole tissue box.</span>
<a name="l8634"><span class="ln">8634 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Where’s Grady?’ Jack bounces downstairs.</span>
<a name="l8635"><span class="ln">8635 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Then Jack can go shopping,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l8636"><span class="ln">8636 </span></a><span class="s0">Panic lights Jack’s eyes.</span>
<a name="l8637"><span class="ln">8637 </span></a><span class="s0">But I’ve sunk a lot into it.</span>
<a name="l8638"><span class="ln">8638 </span></a><span class="s0">Too much.’ He rubs his reddened eyes.</span>

<a name="l8648"><span class="ln">8648 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I couldn’t find any money in the office,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l8649"><span class="ln">8649 </span></a><span class="s0">That’d be great, Sam.</span>
<a name="l8650"><span class="ln">8650 </span></a><span class="s0">I think I’m about to keep you.’ He smiles.</span>
<a name="l8651"><span class="ln">8651 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’re going to live off gruel.’ Moxie’s voice turns dangerous.</span>
<a name="l8652"><span class="ln">8652 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Listen here, Jack.</span>
<a name="l8653"><span class="ln">8653 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie’s smile is sweet poison.</span>
<a name="l8654"><span class="ln">8654 </span></a><span class="s0">Usually he fits with Moxie.</span>
<a name="l8655"><span class="ln">8655 </span></a><span class="s0">He bobs up and down awkwardly.</span>
<a name="l8656"><span class="ln">8656 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack eyes him and then snorts.</span>
<a name="l8657"><span class="ln">8657 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You look ridiculous.</span>

<a name="l8659"><span class="ln">8659 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack has a devilish spark in his eyes.</span>
<a name="l8660"><span class="ln">8660 </span></a><span class="s0">People jump clear with gasps.</span>
<a name="l8661"><span class="ln">8661 </span></a><span class="s0">The baby shrieks in delight.</span>
<a name="l8662"><span class="ln">8662 </span></a><span class="s0">Then Jack attempts to slow them down— and fails.</span>
<a name="l8663"><span class="ln">8663 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ow,’ Sam says with a broken face.</span>
<a name="l8664"><span class="ln">8664 </span></a><span class="s0">The baby pats his cheek.</span>
<a name="l8665"><span class="ln">8665 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ow-ow, Sammy.’ Moxie storms over.</span>
<a name="l8666"><span class="ln">8666 </span></a><span class="s0">He raises his arms in self-defence.</span>
<a name="l8667"><span class="ln">8667 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Jack’s idea.’ Moxie whirls on Jack.</span>
<a name="l8668"><span class="ln">8668 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re a terrible influence on him.</span>

<a name="l8670"><span class="ln">8670 </span></a><span class="s0">But his pockets are empty.</span>
<a name="l8671"><span class="ln">8671 </span></a><span class="s0">And Moxie said he was turning into a De Lainey.</span>
<a name="l8672"><span class="ln">8672 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy is fourteen and there are knives in his belly.</span>
<a name="l8673"><span class="ln">8673 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so hungry.</span>
<a name="l8674"><span class="ln">8674 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s fast now.</span>
<a name="l8675"><span class="ln">8675 </span></a><span class="s0">Fast at locks.</span>
<a name="l8676"><span class="ln">8676 </span></a><span class="s0">Slow to notice his brother cracking around the edges.</span>
<a name="l8677"><span class="ln">8677 </span></a><span class="s0">The bunk bed creaks.</span>
<a name="l8678"><span class="ln">8678 </span></a><span class="s0">A small thump.</span>
<a name="l8679"><span class="ln">8679 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I know you’re freaking out about something.</span>
<a name="l8680"><span class="ln">8680 </span></a><span class="s0">He could eat nine right now.</span>
<a name="l8681"><span class="ln">8681 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Is my brain broken?’ Sammy stiffens.</span>
<a name="l8682"><span class="ln">8682 </span></a><span class="s0">He stays very still.</span>
<a name="l8683"><span class="ln">8683 </span></a><span class="s0">‘They and the others … they copy me.</span>
<a name="l8684"><span class="ln">8684 </span></a><span class="s0">Like when I tic and—’ He stops.</span>
<a name="l8685"><span class="ln">8685 </span></a><span class="s0">‘They think I don’t get that they’re laughing at me.</span>
<a name="l8686"><span class="ln">8686 </span></a><span class="s0">But I do.’ ‘There’s nothing wrong with you.’ Silence.</span>
<a name="l8687"><span class="ln">8687 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Did they do something to you?</span>
<a name="l8688"><span class="ln">8688 </span></a><span class="s0">You have to tell me, OK?</span>
<a name="l8689"><span class="ln">8689 </span></a><span class="s0">He groans and knuckles his eyes.</span>
<a name="l8690"><span class="ln">8690 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I won’t hit anyone.</span>
<a name="l8691"><span class="ln">8691 </span></a><span class="s0">A shudder runs across Avery’s thin shoulders.</span>
<a name="l8692"><span class="ln">8692 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Avery?’ Sammy whispers.</span>
<a name="l8693"><span class="ln">8693 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Please talk to me.’ Avery starts to cry.</span>
<a name="l8694"><span class="ln">8694 </span></a><span class="s0">They come back with treasure.</span>
<a name="l8695"><span class="ln">8695 </span></a><span class="s0">Peculiar costumes to rip apart.</span>
<a name="l8696"><span class="ln">8696 </span></a><span class="s0">Strange tins of buttons.</span>
<a name="l8697"><span class="ln">8697 </span></a><span class="s0">Odd hats to remake.</span>
<a name="l8698"><span class="ln">8698 </span></a><span class="s0">He sold the desk from the office.</span>
<a name="l8699"><span class="ln">8699 </span></a><span class="s0">He hasn’t mentioned the missing money again.</span>
<a name="l8700"><span class="ln">8700 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam sifts through buttons.</span>
<a name="l8701"><span class="ln">8701 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery would love doing this.</span>
<a name="l8702"><span class="ln">8702 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam is consumed with sorting and nothing else.</span>
<a name="l8703"><span class="ln">8703 </span></a><span class="s0">Because this he can do.</span>
<a name="l8704"><span class="ln">8704 </span></a><span class="s0">This is safe.</span>
<a name="l8705"><span class="ln">8705 </span></a><span class="s0">Time to put on popcorn.</span>
<a name="l8706"><span class="ln">8706 </span></a><span class="s0">The keys stare at him with rows of metallic teeth.</span>
<a name="l8707"><span class="ln">8707 </span></a><span class="s0">The wallet is old, seams popping.</span>
<a name="l8708"><span class="ln">8708 </span></a><span class="s0">Just … don’t.</span>
<a name="l8709"><span class="ln">8709 </span></a><span class="s0">He sees Mr De Lainey’s disappointed eyes.</span>
<a name="l8710"><span class="ln">8710 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s understanding slice of a smile.</span>
<a name="l8711"><span class="ln">8711 </span></a><span class="s0">He owed everything to those keys.</span>
<a name="l8712"><span class="ln">8712 </span></a><span class="s0">Fingers shaking, he unhooks the house key.</span>
<a name="l8713"><span class="ln">8713 </span></a><span class="s0">He puts it in his pocket.</span>
<a name="l8714"><span class="ln">8714 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t touch the wallet.</span>
<a name="l8715"><span class="ln">8715 </span></a><span class="s0">The pocketed key digs into his thigh.</span>
<a name="l8716"><span class="ln">8716 </span></a><span class="s0">whywhywhywhy what if they saw— Sam takes a breath.</span>
<a name="l8717"><span class="ln">8717 </span></a><span class="s0">No one saw.</span>
<a name="l8718"><span class="ln">8718 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie will come down soon.</span>
<a name="l8719"><span class="ln">8719 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Saaaaammy,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l8720"><span class="ln">8720 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sam.’ Jeremy pats Sam’s knee.</span>
<a name="l8721"><span class="ln">8721 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam does the logical thing – he panics.</span>
<a name="l8722"><span class="ln">8722 </span></a><span class="s0">They’ll see what a miserable pathetic creep he is.</span>
<a name="l8723"><span class="ln">8723 </span></a><span class="s0">Who steals house keys?</span>
<a name="l8724"><span class="ln">8724 </span></a><span class="s0">Who does that?</span>
<a name="l8725"><span class="ln">8725 </span></a><span class="s0">Mischief lights Jack’s eyes.</span>
<a name="l8726"><span class="ln">8726 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he stiffens right back up.</span>
<a name="l8727"><span class="ln">8727 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Since you’re here so much,’ Jeremy says.</span>
<a name="l8728"><span class="ln">8728 </span></a><span class="s0">This is worse than being caught with the key.</span>
<a name="l8729"><span class="ln">8729 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I haven’t …’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l8730"><span class="ln">8730 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dude, she has so.</span>
<a name="l8731"><span class="ln">8731 </span></a><span class="s0">Remember that kid with the glasses last year?</span>
<a name="l8732"><span class="ln">8732 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sam is practically a live-in.’ They have no idea.</span>
<a name="l8733"><span class="ln">8733 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Shut up.’ Jeremy is calmly pleasant.</span>
<a name="l8734"><span class="ln">8734 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And you’ll kill me if I hurt her?</span>
<a name="l8735"><span class="ln">8735 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s cliché, guys.’ ‘Moxie can pound you herself,’ Jeremy says.</span>
<a name="l8736"><span class="ln">8736 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Why so complicated?</span>
<a name="l8737"><span class="ln">8737 </span></a><span class="s0">Just say we’ll kill him.’ ‘We’ll kill you,’ says Jack.</span>
<a name="l8738"><span class="ln">8738 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Bloodily.’ ‘Well, I’m not doing anything.’ Sam clutches buttons.</span>
<a name="l8739"><span class="ln">8739 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s a pause.</span>
<a name="l8740"><span class="ln">8740 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sometimes the babies need helpful hints.</span>
<a name="l8741"><span class="ln">8741 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s a thump on the stairs and then Moxie appears.</span>
<a name="l8742"><span class="ln">8742 </span></a><span class="s0">Her brows tighten in that trademark lemon scowl.</span>
<a name="l8743"><span class="ln">8743 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’re just giving him the safe sex talk.’ Sam chokes.</span>
<a name="l8744"><span class="ln">8744 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy whacks him helpfully on the back.</span>
<a name="l8745"><span class="ln">8745 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie folds her arms.</span>
<a name="l8746"><span class="ln">8746 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie is pure darkness.</span>
<a name="l8747"><span class="ln">8747 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Would you like to bet?’ ‘We’d tell Dad,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l8748"><span class="ln">8748 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You guys aren’t allowed to drink?’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l8749"><span class="ln">8749 </span></a><span class="s0">Safe and strict.</span>
<a name="l8750"><span class="ln">8750 </span></a><span class="s0">So no drinking.</span>
<a name="l8751"><span class="ln">8751 </span></a><span class="s0">Or swearing.’ ‘Or sex,’ Jack adds.</span>
<a name="l8752"><span class="ln">8752 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie smiles sweetly.</span>
<a name="l8753"><span class="ln">8753 </span></a><span class="s0">How could I forget?</span>
<a name="l8754"><span class="ln">8754 </span></a><span class="s0">All our friends thought we’d died.’ Jack looks like murder.</span>
<a name="l8755"><span class="ln">8755 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I hate you, Moxie.’ She batters her eyelashes.</span>
<a name="l8756"><span class="ln">8756 </span></a><span class="s0">I have stuff to do!</span>
<a name="l8757"><span class="ln">8757 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie plops down beside Sam.</span>
<a name="l8758"><span class="ln">8758 </span></a><span class="s0">He resists the urge to close his fingers around it.</span>
<a name="l8759"><span class="ln">8759 </span></a><span class="s0">What’s wrong with him?</span>
<a name="l8760"><span class="ln">8760 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s voice is soft.</span>

<a name="l8762"><span class="ln">8762 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Lie down,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l8763"><span class="ln">8763 </span></a><span class="s0">His world grows crushingly tight.</span>
<a name="l8764"><span class="ln">8764 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t know what to do.</span>
<a name="l8765"><span class="ln">8765 </span></a><span class="s0">What he’s allowed to feel.</span>
<a name="l8766"><span class="ln">8766 </span></a><span class="s0">She puts a hand on his chest.</span>
<a name="l8767"><span class="ln">8767 </span></a><span class="s0">Spreads her fingers out.</span>
<a name="l8768"><span class="ln">8768 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s holding Moxie.</span>
<a name="l8769"><span class="ln">8769 </span></a><span class="s0">He will never move again.</span>
<a name="l8770"><span class="ln">8770 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We should probably talk,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l8771"><span class="ln">8771 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam closes his eyes.</span>
<a name="l8772"><span class="ln">8772 </span></a><span class="s0">I shouldn’t—’ ‘No.</span>
<a name="l8773"><span class="ln">8773 </span></a><span class="s0">I wouldn’t change a single day.</span>

<a name="l8776"><span class="ln">8776 </span></a><span class="s0">And I want to scream.</span>
<a name="l8777"><span class="ln">8777 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants to be— something.</span>

<a name="l8779"><span class="ln">8779 </span></a><span class="s0">Then I found you.</span>
<a name="l8780"><span class="ln">8780 </span></a><span class="s0">What does he say?</span>
<a name="l8781"><span class="ln">8781 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t want it to end?</span>

<a name="l8787"><span class="ln">8787 </span></a><span class="s0">A smile curves half her lips.</span>
<a name="l8788"><span class="ln">8788 </span></a><span class="s0">‘AHEM.’ Moxie shrieks and falls backwards off the sofa.</span>
<a name="l8789"><span class="ln">8789 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam shoots upright, guilt plastered thickly on his face.</span>
<a name="l8790"><span class="ln">8790 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But Dad said Sam can spend the night.</span>
<a name="l8791"><span class="ln">8791 </span></a><span class="s0">So long as he calls his parents.’ He pauses.</span>

<a name="l8796"><span class="ln">8796 </span></a><span class="s0">Wow, you weirdos.’ He turns to go and then backtracks.</span>
<a name="l8797"><span class="ln">8797 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I guess you don’t need advice, Sammy.’ He winks.</span>
<a name="l8798"><span class="ln">8798 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam pulls a pillow over his face.</span>
<a name="l8799"><span class="ln">8799 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie shoots a suspicious look from one to the other.</span>
<a name="l8800"><span class="ln">8800 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Excuse me?’ ‘Nothing.’ Jeremy cheerfully flees.</span>
<a name="l8801"><span class="ln">8801 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s like I live here or something,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l8802"><span class="ln">8802 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s like you live here or something,’ she agrees.</span>
<a name="l8803"><span class="ln">8803 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone always smuggles alcohol and we light a bonfire.</span>
<a name="l8804"><span class="ln">8804 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like the last holiday hurrah.’ ‘I … can’t.</span>
<a name="l8805"><span class="ln">8805 </span></a><span class="s0">If someone knows me—’ ‘No one’s going to know you.</span>
<a name="l8806"><span class="ln">8806 </span></a><span class="s0">No one will recognise him.</span>
<a name="l8807"><span class="ln">8807 </span></a><span class="s0">She smacks his chest.</span>
<a name="l8808"><span class="ln">8808 </span></a><span class="s0">Because, for starters, it’s a waistcoat.</span>
<a name="l8809"><span class="ln">8809 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Obviously,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l8810"><span class="ln">8810 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll finish my dress,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l8811"><span class="ln">8811 </span></a><span class="s0">To being utterly invisible.</span>
<a name="l8812"><span class="ln">8812 </span></a><span class="s0">A shutter tips over her eyes.</span>
<a name="l8813"><span class="ln">8813 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Can we talk about it later?</span>
<a name="l8814"><span class="ln">8814 </span></a><span class="s0">We’ll work it out.</span>
<a name="l8815"><span class="ln">8815 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m not going to say goodbye.’ Her voice is fierce.</span>
<a name="l8816"><span class="ln">8816 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants to tell her everything.</span>
<a name="l8817"><span class="ln">8817 </span></a><span class="s0">That he steals keys because he’s desperate to belong.</span>
<a name="l8818"><span class="ln">8818 </span></a><span class="s0">She kisses him.</span>
<a name="l8819"><span class="ln">8819 </span></a><span class="s0">He tips his head up to catch it.</span>
<a name="l8820"><span class="ln">8820 </span></a><span class="s0">She’s soft and warm, summer nights and sugar.</span>
<a name="l8821"><span class="ln">8821 </span></a><span class="s0">His brain shuts off.</span>
<a name="l8822"><span class="ln">8822 </span></a><span class="s0">His hands circle her back.</span>
<a name="l8823"><span class="ln">8823 </span></a><span class="s0">He did something wrong.</span>
<a name="l8824"><span class="ln">8824 </span></a><span class="s0">Of course he did.</span>
<a name="l8825"><span class="ln">8825 </span></a><span class="s0">He screwed it— ‘I’m sorry,’ he’s saying, breathless and panicked.</span>
<a name="l8826"><span class="ln">8826 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well, that I can tell.</span>
<a name="l8827"><span class="ln">8827 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s hands start to shake.</span>
<a name="l8828"><span class="ln">8828 </span></a><span class="s0">She tilts his chin up.</span>

<a name="l8830"><span class="ln">8830 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s OK to move your face, you know.</span>
<a name="l8831"><span class="ln">8831 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Perfect,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l8832"><span class="ln">8832 </span></a><span class="s0">Then kisses him again.</span>
<a name="l8833"><span class="ln">8833 </span></a><span class="s0">It matches her hair.</span>
<a name="l8834"><span class="ln">8834 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood and fire.</span>
<a name="l8835"><span class="ln">8835 </span></a><span class="s0">Her lips curl with disapproval.</span>
<a name="l8836"><span class="ln">8836 </span></a><span class="s0">Or hide her.</span>
<a name="l8837"><span class="ln">8837 </span></a><span class="s0">It tumbles out in anguish.</span>
<a name="l8838"><span class="ln">8838 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s never a tantrum.</span>
<a name="l8839"><span class="ln">8839 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie’s fingers curl over Sam’s arm.</span>
<a name="l8840"><span class="ln">8840 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Who is she?</span>
<a name="l8841"><span class="ln">8841 </span></a><span class="s0">Engine still running.</span>
<a name="l8842"><span class="ln">8842 </span></a><span class="s0">She’s going to wake up the whole house.</span>
<a name="l8843"><span class="ln">8843 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I have to go.’ Sam turns to Moxie, desperate now.</span>
<a name="l8844"><span class="ln">8844 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Please, just …’ Just what, Sam?</span>
<a name="l8845"><span class="ln">8845 </span></a><span class="s0">Just what the hell will you tell her?</span>
<a name="l8846"><span class="ln">8846 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Tell me what’s going on!’ Moxie cries from the doorway.</span>
<a name="l8847"><span class="ln">8847 </span></a><span class="s0">He gets into Vin’s car.</span>
<a name="l8848"><span class="ln">8848 </span></a><span class="s0">All he has is a desperate need for Avery.</span>
<a name="l8849"><span class="ln">8849 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Tell me what happened.’ Sam’s voice is too high.</span>
<a name="l8850"><span class="ln">8850 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Where is he?</span>
<a name="l8851"><span class="ln">8851 </span></a><span class="s0">At your place?</span>
<a name="l8852"><span class="ln">8852 </span></a><span class="s0">Since he can’t shut up.</span>
<a name="l8853"><span class="ln">8853 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin’s only kindness is truly selfishness.</span>
<a name="l8854"><span class="ln">8854 </span></a><span class="s0">The car spins downtown.</span>
<a name="l8855"><span class="ln">8855 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He’s autistic.’ Sam grinds each word like crushed glass.</span>
<a name="l8856"><span class="ln">8856 </span></a><span class="s0">And you threw it all at him?</span>
<a name="l8857"><span class="ln">8857 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like being hit in the stomach.</span>
<a name="l8858"><span class="ln">8858 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam rips out of his seat before they even stop.</span>
<a name="l8859"><span class="ln">8859 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t hear Vin follow.</span>
<a name="l8860"><span class="ln">8860 </span></a><span class="s0">His own work.</span>
<a name="l8861"><span class="ln">8861 </span></a><span class="s0">His world is spinning out from under him.</span>
<a name="l8862"><span class="ln">8862 </span></a><span class="s0">He screams and screams.</span>
<a name="l8863"><span class="ln">8863 </span></a><span class="s0">They’ve pushed him too much.</span>
<a name="l8864"><span class="ln">8864 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No, just leave him alone.</span>
<a name="l8865"><span class="ln">8865 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ve got him.</span>
<a name="l8866"><span class="ln">8866 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s selfish fault.</span>
<a name="l8867"><span class="ln">8867 </span></a><span class="s0">His screams pitch higher.</span>
<a name="l8868"><span class="ln">8868 </span></a><span class="s0">Calm him down with pressure.</span>
<a name="l8869"><span class="ln">8869 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s fist connects with Sam’s stomach.</span>
<a name="l8870"><span class="ln">8870 </span></a><span class="s0">again Sam takes it all with the smallest grunt.</span>
<a name="l8871"><span class="ln">8871 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam doesn’t care.</span>
<a name="l8872"><span class="ln">8872 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re OK.’ ‘I c-c-c-can’t—’ ‘You don’t have to,’ Sam whispers.</span>
<a name="l8873"><span class="ln">8873 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I got you.</span>
<a name="l8874"><span class="ln">8874 </span></a><span class="s0">… embarrassing me, she’d said.</span>
<a name="l8875"><span class="ln">8875 </span></a><span class="s0">How’s he going to move Avery?</span>
<a name="l8876"><span class="ln">8876 </span></a><span class="s0">They have nowhere to go.</span>
<a name="l8877"><span class="ln">8877 </span></a><span class="s0">Life is always so sickeningly cruel.</span>
<a name="l8878"><span class="ln">8878 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam holds him tighter.</span>
<a name="l8879"><span class="ln">8879 </span></a><span class="s0">He knows where to go.</span>
<a name="l8880"><span class="ln">8880 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t be doing this.</span>
<a name="l8881"><span class="ln">8881 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll ruin everything.</span>
<a name="l8882"><span class="ln">8882 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s doing this.</span>
<a name="l8883"><span class="ln">8883 </span></a><span class="s0">He hates being this cruel.</span>
<a name="l8884"><span class="ln">8884 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s soul is bleeding out.</span>
<a name="l8885"><span class="ln">8885 </span></a><span class="s0">But they made it.</span>
<a name="l8886"><span class="ln">8886 </span></a><span class="s0">She’ll be furious he ran out like that.</span>
<a name="l8887"><span class="ln">8887 </span></a><span class="s0">Their kiss, so sweet before, feels like memories of ash.</span>
<a name="l8888"><span class="ln">8888 </span></a><span class="s0">The shirt is probably Jeremy’s.</span>
<a name="l8889"><span class="ln">8889 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam has so much stealing to apologise for.</span>
<a name="l8890"><span class="ln">8890 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I c-c-c-can’t …’ He stops.</span>
<a name="l8891"><span class="ln">8891 </span></a><span class="s0">A sob tears free.</span>
<a name="l8892"><span class="ln">8892 </span></a><span class="s0">Pressure to calm him.</span>
<a name="l8893"><span class="ln">8893 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s breathing slows as Sam holds him tight.</span>
<a name="l8894"><span class="ln">8894 </span></a><span class="s0">A sandwich of Lou boys in a stolen house.</span>
<a name="l8895"><span class="ln">8895 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We have to be quiet,’ Sam whispers.</span>
<a name="l8896"><span class="ln">8896 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But tomorrow I … I’m going to fix it.</span>
<a name="l8897"><span class="ln">8897 </span></a><span class="s0">No, the De Laineys are not like that.</span>
<a name="l8898"><span class="ln">8898 </span></a><span class="s0">Failing owning one, Sam decided to be one.</span>
<a name="l8899"><span class="ln">8899 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m … I’m sorry I wasn’t there.</span>
<a name="l8900"><span class="ln">8900 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he goes completely still.</span>
<a name="l8901"><span class="ln">8901 </span></a><span class="s0">A small sigh escapes.</span>
<a name="l8902"><span class="ln">8902 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam would save him a million times.</span>
<a name="l8903"><span class="ln">8903 </span></a><span class="s0">He’d never hesitate.</span>
<a name="l8904"><span class="ln">8904 </span></a><span class="s0">But you can’t hide Avery.</span>
<a name="l8905"><span class="ln">8905 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s perfect summer is a hot slap against his cheek.</span>
<a name="l8906"><span class="ln">8906 </span></a><span class="s0">He wakes to a toe in his ribs.</span>
<a name="l8907"><span class="ln">8907 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam jerks toward the sofa but it’s empty.</span>
<a name="l8908"><span class="ln">8908 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I need explanations,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l8909"><span class="ln">8909 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Many of them.</span>
<a name="l8910"><span class="ln">8910 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What the hell, Sam?’ He kneads his eyes.</span>
<a name="l8911"><span class="ln">8911 </span></a><span class="s0">‘My … my brother needed help.’ Where is he?</span>
<a name="l8912"><span class="ln">8912 </span></a><span class="s0">But I have to ask now, Sam.</span>
<a name="l8913"><span class="ln">8913 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Is this your autistic brother?</span>
<a name="l8914"><span class="ln">8914 </span></a><span class="s0">Is he safe right now?’ ‘I don’t know,’ Sam whispers.</span>
<a name="l8915"><span class="ln">8915 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We need to tell my dad,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l8916"><span class="ln">8916 </span></a><span class="s0">He opens his mouth to – what?</span>
<a name="l8917"><span class="ln">8917 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe just agree?</span>
<a name="l8918"><span class="ln">8918 </span></a><span class="s0">Do you have an extremely cute and slightly taller doppelgänger?</span>
<a name="l8919"><span class="ln">8919 </span></a><span class="s0">Because one is currently abusing our poor gate.</span>
<a name="l8920"><span class="ln">8920 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam left his heartbeat inside.</span>
<a name="l8921"><span class="ln">8921 </span></a><span class="s0">But Avery’s OK.</span>
<a name="l8922"><span class="ln">8922 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Where’d you go?’ Sam says softly.</span>
<a name="l8923"><span class="ln">8923 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Come back inside.</span>
<a name="l8924"><span class="ln">8924 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyes are smudged with exhaustion, his lips bitten bloody.</span>
<a name="l8925"><span class="ln">8925 </span></a><span class="s0">‘If you tell, they’ll s-send you to jail,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l8926"><span class="ln">8926 </span></a><span class="s0">‘All … this?</span>
<a name="l8927"><span class="ln">8927 </span></a><span class="s0">Sunday night waffles.</span>
<a name="l8928"><span class="ln">8928 </span></a><span class="s0">Lying on the grass with mango pips.</span>
<a name="l8929"><span class="ln">8929 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam leans across the gate.</span>
<a name="l8930"><span class="ln">8930 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll risk it for you.</span>
<a name="l8931"><span class="ln">8931 </span></a><span class="s0">I rebuilt her car.’ His split lips tip downwards.</span>
<a name="l8932"><span class="ln">8932 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t be like that.’ Sam’s voice stays low.</span>
<a name="l8933"><span class="ln">8933 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You really can’t.’ Heat flares in Sam’s chest.</span>
<a name="l8934"><span class="ln">8934 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You just fall apart.</span>
<a name="l8935"><span class="ln">8935 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks wretched, tired and hollowed out.</span>
<a name="l8936"><span class="ln">8936 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s throat closes.</span>
<a name="l8937"><span class="ln">8937 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I like your hands better this way,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l8938"><span class="ln">8938 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam looks down in confusion.</span>
<a name="l8939"><span class="ln">8939 </span></a><span class="s0">His knuckles are smooth.</span>
<a name="l8940"><span class="ln">8940 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Vin says you’re soft.</span>
<a name="l8941"><span class="ln">8941 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You don’t belong in a house,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l8942"><span class="ln">8942 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’re the kings of nowhere, remember?</span>
<a name="l8943"><span class="ln">8943 </span></a><span class="s0">No one can solve the puzzle that is Sammy Lou.</span>
<a name="l8944"><span class="ln">8944 </span></a><span class="s0">They shouldn’t even try.</span>
<a name="l8945"><span class="ln">8945 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You can call Vin if you need me.</span>
<a name="l8946"><span class="ln">8946 </span></a><span class="s0">But I’m leaving now.’ If he needs Avery?</span>
<a name="l8947"><span class="ln">8947 </span></a><span class="s0">More like when Avery needs him.</span>
<a name="l8948"><span class="ln">8948 </span></a><span class="s0">But he thinks Avery means it.</span>
<a name="l8949"><span class="ln">8949 </span></a><span class="s0">He thinks Avery’s trying to be a big brother.</span>
<a name="l8950"><span class="ln">8950 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam could laugh.</span>
<a name="l8951"><span class="ln">8951 </span></a><span class="s0">Or maybe just cry.</span>
<a name="l8952"><span class="ln">8952 </span></a><span class="s0">But he doesn’t.</span>
<a name="l8953"><span class="ln">8953 </span></a><span class="s0">‘After the beach party,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l8954"><span class="ln">8954 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Then we’re officially talking to my dad.</span>
<a name="l8955"><span class="ln">8955 </span></a><span class="s0">About everything.’ He just nods.</span>
<a name="l8956"><span class="ln">8956 </span></a><span class="s0">No, he’s not.</span>
<a name="l8957"><span class="ln">8957 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam looks down at his fingers wrapped around Avery’s phone.</span>
<a name="l8958"><span class="ln">8958 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam stitches on a pretend smile.</span>
<a name="l8959"><span class="ln">8959 </span></a><span class="s0">But having dozens of eyes look at him?</span>
<a name="l8960"><span class="ln">8960 </span></a><span class="s0">He loathes that.</span>
<a name="l8961"><span class="ln">8961 </span></a><span class="s0">Six pairs of eyes immediately lock on Sam.</span>
<a name="l8962"><span class="ln">8962 </span></a><span class="s0">You look incredible.</span>
<a name="l8963"><span class="ln">8963 </span></a><span class="s0">The waistcoat is marvellous.</span>
<a name="l8964"><span class="ln">8964 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s burgundy and rust and charcoal and gold.</span>
<a name="l8965"><span class="ln">8965 </span></a><span class="s0">And it’s slim fitting.</span>
<a name="l8966"><span class="ln">8966 </span></a><span class="s0">No one will know.</span>
<a name="l8967"><span class="ln">8967 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs it.</span>
<a name="l8968"><span class="ln">8968 </span></a><span class="s0">No one has ever called Sam a gentleman before.</span>
<a name="l8969"><span class="ln">8969 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t think about it right now.</span>
<a name="l8970"><span class="ln">8970 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack doesn’t look up from his phone.</span>
<a name="l8971"><span class="ln">8971 </span></a><span class="s0">‘The sun’s not fully down yet.</span>
<a name="l8972"><span class="ln">8972 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No,’ says Jack.</span>
<a name="l8973"><span class="ln">8973 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What have you been doing all this time?’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l8974"><span class="ln">8974 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr De Lainey pops raisins in his mouth.</span>
<a name="l8975"><span class="ln">8975 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well.’ He pauses.</span>
<a name="l8976"><span class="ln">8976 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well … you need pants.’ Jeremy looks down.</span>
<a name="l8977"><span class="ln">8977 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh, yeah.’ ‘And a different shirt,’ Jack adds, stealing gingerbread.</span>
<a name="l8978"><span class="ln">8978 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy nods several times and bolts back upstairs.</span>
<a name="l8979"><span class="ln">8979 </span></a><span class="s0">I need to wear a salmon.</span>
<a name="l8980"><span class="ln">8980 </span></a><span class="s0">OK.’ Moxie glances at Jack.</span>
<a name="l8981"><span class="ln">8981 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Does he have a new crush?</span>
<a name="l8982"><span class="ln">8982 </span></a><span class="s0">Is that why he’s flapping?’ Jack shrugs.</span>

<a name="l8984"><span class="ln">8984 </span></a><span class="s0">Their father sighs and looks very old.</span>
<a name="l8985"><span class="ln">8985 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam nudges Moxie with his knee.</span>
<a name="l8986"><span class="ln">8986 </span></a><span class="s0">Whatever that means.</span>
<a name="l8987"><span class="ln">8987 </span></a><span class="s0">But the dress has a secret.</span>
<a name="l8988"><span class="ln">8988 </span></a><span class="s0">The skirt flares out to a perfect circle.</span>
<a name="l8989"><span class="ln">8989 </span></a><span class="s0">She is the sun and her eyes burn stars.</span>
<a name="l8990"><span class="ln">8990 </span></a><span class="s0">Her smile is glory and pride and infectious delight.</span>
<a name="l8991"><span class="ln">8991 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr De Lainey looks like he’s about to cry.</span>
<a name="l8992"><span class="ln">8992 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Moxie, darling, you’re beautiful.</span>
<a name="l8993"><span class="ln">8993 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m taking a picture.</span>
<a name="l8994"><span class="ln">8994 </span></a><span class="s0">Everyone on the stairs!</span>
<a name="l8995"><span class="ln">8995 </span></a><span class="s0">They shuffle and poke each other.</span>
<a name="l8996"><span class="ln">8996 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy leans on Grady.</span>
<a name="l8997"><span class="ln">8997 </span></a><span class="s0">Dash picks up Toby.</span>
<a name="l8998"><span class="ln">8998 </span></a><span class="s0">A stray curl falls over Moxie’s eyes.</span>
<a name="l8999"><span class="ln">8999 </span></a><span class="s0">They share a smile.</span>
<a name="l9000"><span class="ln">9000 </span></a><span class="s0">It really, really hurts.</span>
<a name="l9001"><span class="ln">9001 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t lose this.</span>
<a name="l9002"><span class="ln">9002 </span></a><span class="s0">The beach is a fairyland of lights like broken stars.</span>
<a name="l9003"><span class="ln">9003 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s mostly kids from school,’ Grady says.</span>
<a name="l9004"><span class="ln">9004 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And their friends and friends of friends.</span>
<a name="l9005"><span class="ln">9005 </span></a><span class="s0">The rich ones started it.</span>
<a name="l9006"><span class="ln">9006 </span></a><span class="s0">Rich kids get away with a lot.’ Sam won’t argue.</span>
<a name="l9007"><span class="ln">9007 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam ignores his tightening lungs.</span>
<a name="l9008"><span class="ln">9008 </span></a><span class="s0">Everything clashes together.</span>
<a name="l9009"><span class="ln">9009 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t freak out.</span>
<a name="l9010"><span class="ln">9010 </span></a><span class="s0">No one knows you.</span>
<a name="l9011"><span class="ln">9011 </span></a><span class="s0">There is no way anyone here will recognise you.</span>
<a name="l9012"><span class="ln">9012 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Anyway, why are you saying “we”?</span>
<a name="l9013"><span class="ln">9013 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Loser.’ The crowd swallows them.</span>
<a name="l9014"><span class="ln">9014 </span></a><span class="s0">Grady lays a hand on Sam and Moxie’s shoulders.</span>
<a name="l9015"><span class="ln">9015 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m nineteen, not ninety.</span>
<a name="l9016"><span class="ln">9016 </span></a><span class="s0">And all my old school friends still come.</span>
<a name="l9017"><span class="ln">9017 </span></a><span class="s0">Also Isla’s here.’ He clears his throat.</span>
<a name="l9018"><span class="ln">9018 </span></a><span class="s0">‘So no drinking.’ ‘Obviously.’ Moxie folds her arms.</span>
<a name="l9019"><span class="ln">9019 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t wander off someplace dark.’ Grady shudders.</span>
<a name="l9020"><span class="ln">9020 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ha,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l9021"><span class="ln">9021 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie slips her hand into his.</span>
<a name="l9022"><span class="ln">9022 </span></a><span class="s0">‘This rule I can do.</span>
<a name="l9023"><span class="ln">9023 </span></a><span class="s0">But seriously, are you OK, Sam?</span>
<a name="l9024"><span class="ln">9024 </span></a><span class="s0">You do look peaky.’ Oh, totally fine.</span>
<a name="l9025"><span class="ln">9025 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m fine.’ He is not fine.</span>
<a name="l9026"><span class="ln">9026 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s about to lose everything.</span>
<a name="l9027"><span class="ln">9027 </span></a><span class="s0">He is not fine.</span>
<a name="l9028"><span class="ln">9028 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That’s his girlfriend, Isla,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l9029"><span class="ln">9029 </span></a><span class="s0">She’s super gorgeous too.</span>
<a name="l9030"><span class="ln">9030 </span></a><span class="s0">Obviously has no standards.</span>
<a name="l9031"><span class="ln">9031 </span></a><span class="s0">Anyway.’ She nudges Sam with her hip.</span>
<a name="l9032"><span class="ln">9032 </span></a><span class="s0">People shout Moxie’s name and compliment her dress.</span>
<a name="l9033"><span class="ln">9033 </span></a><span class="s0">Quite a few are barefoot.</span>
<a name="l9034"><span class="ln">9034 </span></a><span class="s0">Quite a few are drunk.</span>
<a name="l9035"><span class="ln">9035 </span></a><span class="s0">Absolutely no one is dressed like Moxie and Sam.</span>
<a name="l9036"><span class="ln">9036 </span></a><span class="s0">Absolutely everyone keeps looking at them.</span>
<a name="l9037"><span class="ln">9037 </span></a><span class="s0">Behind his back.</span>
<a name="l9038"><span class="ln">9038 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hi,’ says Sam.</span>
<a name="l9039"><span class="ln">9039 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s confirmed,’ Kirby says.</span>
<a name="l9040"><span class="ln">9040 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And he helped me sew.</span>
<a name="l9041"><span class="ln">9041 </span></a><span class="s0">He did quite a lot actually.’ ‘Keep him,’ Kirby says.</span>
<a name="l9042"><span class="ln">9042 </span></a><span class="s0">Her cheeks flush and she talks fifty miles a minute.</span>
<a name="l9043"><span class="ln">9043 </span></a><span class="s0">This happyMoxie is a sparkling explosion of life.</span>
<a name="l9044"><span class="ln">9044 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam steps back a little.</span>
<a name="l9045"><span class="ln">9045 </span></a><span class="s0">It scares him.</span>
<a name="l9046"><span class="ln">9046 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re not marks and he’s not stealing.</span>
<a name="l9047"><span class="ln">9047 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t fit here.</span>
<a name="l9048"><span class="ln">9048 </span></a><span class="s0">Take me home.</span>
<a name="l9049"><span class="ln">9049 </span></a><span class="s0">Firelight dances in her eyes.</span>
<a name="l9050"><span class="ln">9050 </span></a><span class="s0">They definitely don’t look ready to go.</span>
<a name="l9051"><span class="ln">9051 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m fine.’ He tries to smile.</span>
<a name="l9052"><span class="ln">9052 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sad-eyed?’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l9053"><span class="ln">9053 </span></a><span class="s0">Just a little.</span>
<a name="l9054"><span class="ln">9054 </span></a><span class="s0">She smiles at that.</span>
<a name="l9055"><span class="ln">9055 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dance with me.</span>
<a name="l9056"><span class="ln">9056 </span></a><span class="s0">Music punches out of the speakers.</span>
<a name="l9057"><span class="ln">9057 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie is all twirling arms and spinning rainbow skirt.</span>
<a name="l9058"><span class="ln">9058 </span></a><span class="s0">She catches Sam’s hands and he whirls her around.</span>
<a name="l9059"><span class="ln">9059 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t dance.</span>
<a name="l9060"><span class="ln">9060 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s all elbows and knees.</span>
<a name="l9061"><span class="ln">9061 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t care.</span>
<a name="l9062"><span class="ln">9062 </span></a><span class="s0">Let him embarrass himself.</span>
<a name="l9063"><span class="ln">9063 </span></a><span class="s0">Just so long as he’s with Moxie.</span>
<a name="l9064"><span class="ln">9064 </span></a><span class="s0">The song ends and Moxie collapses against him.</span>
<a name="l9065"><span class="ln">9065 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Permanently,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l9066"><span class="ln">9066 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Thanks for that, by the way.’ ‘You’re welcome.</span>
<a name="l9067"><span class="ln">9067 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like the entire night sings goodbye.</span>
<a name="l9068"><span class="ln">9068 </span></a><span class="s0">He runs his thumb over her bottom lip.</span>
<a name="l9069"><span class="ln">9069 </span></a><span class="s0">He kisses her.</span>
<a name="l9070"><span class="ln">9070 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam will hold her.</span>
<a name="l9071"><span class="ln">9071 </span></a><span class="s0">It’ll all be fine.</span>
<a name="l9072"><span class="ln">9072 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie sighs into his shoulder.</span>
<a name="l9073"><span class="ln">9073 </span></a><span class="s0">Kirby is jogging towards them, face pinched.</span>
<a name="l9074"><span class="ln">9074 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey!’ he shouts.</span>
<a name="l9075"><span class="ln">9075 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Is that Sammy Lou?’ Sam’s hands drop away from Moxie.</span>
<a name="l9076"><span class="ln">9076 </span></a><span class="s0">The boy releases Sam’s throat.</span>
<a name="l9077"><span class="ln">9077 </span></a><span class="s0">He still can’t breathe.</span>
<a name="l9078"><span class="ln">9078 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What the hell?’ Moxie snaps.</span>
<a name="l9079"><span class="ln">9079 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t touch him.</span>
<a name="l9080"><span class="ln">9080 </span></a><span class="s0">Who are you?’ Kirby arrives, breathless.</span>
<a name="l9081"><span class="ln">9081 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Um, OK, whoa.</span>
<a name="l9082"><span class="ln">9082 </span></a><span class="s0">Let’s calm down.</span>
<a name="l9083"><span class="ln">9083 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie, this is Griffin.</span>
<a name="l9084"><span class="ln">9084 </span></a><span class="s0">Erm, Griffin … Moxie.</span>
<a name="l9085"><span class="ln">9085 </span></a><span class="s0">Or maybe it’s the ocean.</span>
<a name="l9086"><span class="ln">9086 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t quite hear through the roar.</span>
<a name="l9087"><span class="ln">9087 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t quite see.</span>
<a name="l9088"><span class="ln">9088 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs to get out of here.</span>
<a name="l9089"><span class="ln">9089 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You want to explain yourself?</span>
<a name="l9090"><span class="ln">9090 </span></a><span class="s0">Or do I just start yelling for my brothers?</span>
<a name="l9091"><span class="ln">9091 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s stomach knots.</span>
<a name="l9092"><span class="ln">9092 </span></a><span class="s0">‘They go to that public school on the south side.</span>
<a name="l9093"><span class="ln">9093 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And don’t talk like that about his brother.</span>
<a name="l9094"><span class="ln">9094 </span></a><span class="s0">She doesn’t even know Avery.</span>
<a name="l9095"><span class="ln">9095 </span></a><span class="s0">This is the Moxie he loves.</span>
<a name="l9096"><span class="ln">9096 </span></a><span class="s0">Griffin barely glances at her.</span>
<a name="l9097"><span class="ln">9097 </span></a><span class="s0">West is in so much therapy now.</span>
<a name="l9098"><span class="ln">9098 </span></a><span class="s0">You know who this kid is?</span>
<a name="l9099"><span class="ln">9099 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s a raging psychopath.’ Sam looks at his hands.</span>
<a name="l9100"><span class="ln">9100 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery was screaming.</span>
<a name="l9101"><span class="ln">9101 </span></a><span class="s0">Those stupid, goddamn bullies.</span>
<a name="l9102"><span class="ln">9102 </span></a><span class="s0">That’ll stop you twitching.</span>
<a name="l9103"><span class="ln">9103 </span></a><span class="s0">All because Avery thought they were his friends.</span>
<a name="l9104"><span class="ln">9104 </span></a><span class="s0">They strung him along and then cut him down.</span>
<a name="l9105"><span class="ln">9105 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam was going to kill them.</span>
<a name="l9106"><span class="ln">9106 </span></a><span class="s0">He was going to kill them all.</span>
<a name="l9107"><span class="ln">9107 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie turns to Sam.</span>
<a name="l9108"><span class="ln">9108 </span></a><span class="s0">Her face is closed, unreadable, eyes obsidian in the dark.</span>
<a name="l9109"><span class="ln">9109 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll get your brothers, Moxie.’ She runs off.</span>
<a name="l9110"><span class="ln">9110 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You should be in jail!’ Griffin shouts.</span>
<a name="l9111"><span class="ln">9111 </span></a><span class="s0">People are gathering now.</span>
<a name="l9112"><span class="ln">9112 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Call the cops.’ ‘No!’ Moxie cries.</span>
<a name="l9113"><span class="ln">9113 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What else do I need to say?’ Griffin snaps.</span>
<a name="l9114"><span class="ln">9114 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam drops to his knees.</span>
<a name="l9115"><span class="ln">9115 </span></a><span class="s0">Air explodes out of his lungs and doesn’t come back.</span>
<a name="l9116"><span class="ln">9116 </span></a><span class="s0">Yells collide and someone calls out frantically for Moxie.</span>
<a name="l9117"><span class="ln">9117 </span></a><span class="s0">The knot of people tightens.</span>
<a name="l9118"><span class="ln">9118 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam holds his stomach.</span>
<a name="l9119"><span class="ln">9119 </span></a><span class="s0">He tastes tears.</span>
<a name="l9120"><span class="ln">9120 </span></a><span class="s0">Why didn’t you run?</span>
<a name="l9121"><span class="ln">9121 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t you dare hit him,’ she shouts.</span>
<a name="l9122"><span class="ln">9122 </span></a><span class="s0">Griffin staggers a few steps and then spins on Moxie.</span>
<a name="l9123"><span class="ln">9123 </span></a><span class="s0">Hands shoot out.</span>
<a name="l9124"><span class="ln">9124 </span></a><span class="s0">Snatch at shirts.</span>
<a name="l9125"><span class="ln">9125 </span></a><span class="s0">Stop is whispered.</span>
<a name="l9126"><span class="ln">9126 </span></a><span class="s0">She gives the smallest cry.</span>
<a name="l9127"><span class="ln">9127 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s world speeds up.</span>
<a name="l9128"><span class="ln">9128 </span></a><span class="s0">You do not touch Moxie.</span>
<a name="l9129"><span class="ln">9129 </span></a><span class="s0">You do not ever ever ever touch Moxie.</span>
<a name="l9130"><span class="ln">9130 </span></a><span class="s0">To do what they know best.</span>
<a name="l9131"><span class="ln">9131 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t think.</span>
<a name="l9132"><span class="ln">9132 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to stop.</span>
<a name="l9133"><span class="ln">9133 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s sand in his mouth, in his eyes.</span>
<a name="l9134"><span class="ln">9134 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam tries to breathe but he hasn’t lungs any more.</span>
<a name="l9135"><span class="ln">9135 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam jerks away.</span>
<a name="l9136"><span class="ln">9136 </span></a><span class="s0">Griffin holds his broken nose and roars.</span>
<a name="l9137"><span class="ln">9137 </span></a><span class="s0">Their faces blur and spin before him.</span>
<a name="l9138"><span class="ln">9138 </span></a><span class="s0">They are red teeth and burned-out eyes.</span>
<a name="l9139"><span class="ln">9139 </span></a><span class="s0">They are horror and disgust and rage.</span>
<a name="l9140"><span class="ln">9140 </span></a><span class="s0">Scared of him.</span>
<a name="l9141"><span class="ln">9141 </span></a><span class="s0">Just like he was so scared of his father.</span>
<a name="l9142"><span class="ln">9142 </span></a><span class="s0">Only one girl doesn’t move.</span>
<a name="l9143"><span class="ln">9143 </span></a><span class="s0">He runs past her.</span>
<a name="l9144"><span class="ln">9144 </span></a><span class="s0">Run, just run.</span>
<a name="l9145"><span class="ln">9145 </span></a><span class="s0">Just run for ever.</span>
<a name="l9146"><span class="ln">9146 </span></a><span class="s0">It hurts and he’s glad.</span>
<a name="l9147"><span class="ln">9147 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so glad.</span>
<a name="l9148"><span class="ln">9148 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants to hurt.</span>
<a name="l9149"><span class="ln">9149 </span></a><span class="s0">He deserves it.</span>
<a name="l9150"><span class="ln">9150 </span></a><span class="s0">You despicable boy, his aunt said.</span>
<a name="l9151"><span class="ln">9151 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re all right.</span>
<a name="l9152"><span class="ln">9152 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s just like his father.</span>
<a name="l9153"><span class="ln">9153 </span></a><span class="s0">He should be in prison.</span>
<a name="l9154"><span class="ln">9154 </span></a><span class="s0">He picks himself up and runs down the road.</span>
<a name="l9155"><span class="ln">9155 </span></a><span class="s0">He pulls out Avery’s phone.</span>
<a name="l9156"><span class="ln">9156 </span></a><span class="s0">Fix all your problems.</span>
<a name="l9157"><span class="ln">9157 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Vin?’ He’s crying.</span>
<a name="l9158"><span class="ln">9158 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Vin, let me talk to Avery.</span>
<a name="l9159"><span class="ln">9159 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Avery’s busy right now.’ No.</span>
<a name="l9160"><span class="ln">9160 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Please, d-don’t do this.</span>
<a name="l9161"><span class="ln">9161 </span></a><span class="s0">I need him.</span>
<a name="l9162"><span class="ln">9162 </span></a><span class="s0">I need him.’ ‘OK, OK, calm down, kid.</span>
<a name="l9163"><span class="ln">9163 </span></a><span class="s0">I can barely understand you.</span>
<a name="l9164"><span class="ln">9164 </span></a><span class="s0">What happened?’ ‘I h-h-hit … I just h-hit—’ Sam shatters.</span>
<a name="l9165"><span class="ln">9165 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s sobbing now, the phone slipping against his cheek.</span>
<a name="l9166"><span class="ln">9166 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Tell me where you are.</span>
<a name="l9167"><span class="ln">9167 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll come get you.’ ‘I want Avery.</span>
<a name="l9168"><span class="ln">9168 </span></a><span class="s0">Please, I w-want Avery.’ ‘I’ll get him for you, kid.</span>
<a name="l9169"><span class="ln">9169 </span></a><span class="s0">Just hold on.’ It’s an impossible command.</span>
<a name="l9170"><span class="ln">9170 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam has nothing left to hold on to.</span>
<a name="l9171"><span class="ln">9171 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam covers his face.</span>
<a name="l9172"><span class="ln">9172 </span></a><span class="s0">The driver’s door pops open and Vin gets out.</span>
<a name="l9173"><span class="ln">9173 </span></a><span class="s0">Tips Sam’s chin up.</span>
<a name="l9174"><span class="ln">9174 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s blood on his hands.</span>
<a name="l9175"><span class="ln">9175 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Is it yours?’ she says.</span>
<a name="l9176"><span class="ln">9176 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam shakes his head.</span>
<a name="l9177"><span class="ln">9177 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s hollowed out.</span>
<a name="l9178"><span class="ln">9178 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin hauls Sam to his feet.</span>
<a name="l9179"><span class="ln">9179 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin gets in and revs the engine.</span>
<a name="l9180"><span class="ln">9180 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Eat.’ Sam turns his head away.</span>
<a name="l9181"><span class="ln">9181 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m not messing about, kid.</span>
<a name="l9182"><span class="ln">9182 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m going to be sick.’ ‘No, you’re not.</span>
<a name="l9183"><span class="ln">9183 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re taking a bite.</span>
<a name="l9184"><span class="ln">9184 </span></a><span class="s0">Go.’ She revs the engine again.</span>
<a name="l9185"><span class="ln">9185 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I don’t want to hang around here.</span>
<a name="l9186"><span class="ln">9186 </span></a><span class="s0">Do you?’ Sam takes a bite.</span>
<a name="l9187"><span class="ln">9187 </span></a><span class="s0">He tastes blood and no chocolate at all.</span>
<a name="l9188"><span class="ln">9188 </span></a><span class="s0">She doesn’t comment.</span>
<a name="l9189"><span class="ln">9189 </span></a><span class="s0">Chocolate melts and smears on Sam’s fingers.</span>
<a name="l9190"><span class="ln">9190 </span></a><span class="s0">He wipes it on his jeans.</span>
<a name="l9191"><span class="ln">9191 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks at his waistcoat, Moxie’s amazing, detailed work.</span>
<a name="l9192"><span class="ln">9192 </span></a><span class="s0">Bloodstains stare back.</span>
<a name="l9193"><span class="ln">9193 </span></a><span class="s0">‘So Avery’s working,’ Vin says finally.</span>
<a name="l9194"><span class="ln">9194 </span></a><span class="s0">Chocolate help?’ Sam didn’t taste it.</span>
<a name="l9195"><span class="ln">9195 </span></a><span class="s0">But he’s not shaking any more.</span>
<a name="l9196"><span class="ln">9196 </span></a><span class="s0">He leans his head against the window.</span>
<a name="l9197"><span class="ln">9197 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can’t … please.</span>
<a name="l9198"><span class="ln">9198 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll sort it all out, you hear me?</span>
<a name="l9199"><span class="ln">9199 </span></a><span class="s0">The sob comes out unbidden.</span>
<a name="l9200"><span class="ln">9200 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam presses his arm over his mouth.</span>
<a name="l9201"><span class="ln">9201 </span></a><span class="s0">How much goes away?</span>
<a name="l9202"><span class="ln">9202 </span></a><span class="s0">The whole summer?</span>
<a name="l9203"><span class="ln">9203 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing else.’ Vin spins the steering wheel.</span>
<a name="l9204"><span class="ln">9204 </span></a><span class="s0">Streetlights flash in Sam’s eyes.</span>
<a name="l9205"><span class="ln">9205 </span></a><span class="s0">She pulls up and shuts off the engine.</span>
<a name="l9206"><span class="ln">9206 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can’t,’ Sam whispers.</span>
<a name="l9207"><span class="ln">9207 </span></a><span class="s0">Can he even walk right now?</span>
<a name="l9208"><span class="ln">9208 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You do it, or I throw you to the cops.</span>
<a name="l9209"><span class="ln">9209 </span></a><span class="s0">Help me and I fix everything.</span>
<a name="l9210"><span class="ln">9210 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s not a decision.’ Sam swallows.</span>
<a name="l9211"><span class="ln">9211 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Get out of the car,’ Vin says.</span>
<a name="l9212"><span class="ln">9212 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam gets out of the car.</span>
<a name="l9213"><span class="ln">9213 </span></a><span class="s0">They walk three blocks.</span>
<a name="l9214"><span class="ln">9214 </span></a><span class="s0">She has a black duffle bag slung over a shoulder.</span>
<a name="l9215"><span class="ln">9215 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam has to admit – Vin knows what she’s doing.</span>
<a name="l9216"><span class="ln">9216 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s a sense of safety in that.</span>
<a name="l9217"><span class="ln">9217 </span></a><span class="s0">This is why Avery keeps working for her, isn’t it?</span>
<a name="l9218"><span class="ln">9218 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants to be safe, same as Sam.</span>
<a name="l9219"><span class="ln">9219 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t want to be like this.</span>
<a name="l9220"><span class="ln">9220 </span></a><span class="s0">He focuses on Vin’s heeled boots.</span>
<a name="l9221"><span class="ln">9221 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam has no idea what time it is.</span>
<a name="l9222"><span class="ln">9222 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What is this place?’ His voice is low.</span>
<a name="l9223"><span class="ln">9223 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I have a contact overseas.</span>
<a name="l9224"><span class="ln">9224 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s an easy ten grand.’ ‘Ten grand?’ Sam stares.</span>
<a name="l9225"><span class="ln">9225 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin’s red lips twitch.</span>
<a name="l9226"><span class="ln">9226 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You get a cut, little angel.</span>
<a name="l9227"><span class="ln">9227 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery says you’re obsessed with having a house.</span>
<a name="l9228"><span class="ln">9228 </span></a><span class="s0">We can work something out.</span>
<a name="l9229"><span class="ln">9229 </span></a><span class="s0">If you stay on.</span>
<a name="l9230"><span class="ln">9230 </span></a><span class="s0">Keep working for me.’ Sam shifts his gaze away.</span>
<a name="l9231"><span class="ln">9231 </span></a><span class="s0">He wouldn’t – he can’t— He doesn’t want this.</span>
<a name="l9232"><span class="ln">9232 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t want to admit he would fit.</span>
<a name="l9233"><span class="ln">9233 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants to forget what he’s good at.</span>
<a name="l9234"><span class="ln">9234 </span></a><span class="s0">Fists and theft.</span>
<a name="l9235"><span class="ln">9235 </span></a><span class="s0">‘See that window?</span>
<a name="l9236"><span class="ln">9236 </span></a><span class="s0">So they could fly.</span>
<a name="l9237"><span class="ln">9237 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery shouldn’t tell stuff like that.</span>
<a name="l9238"><span class="ln">9238 </span></a><span class="s0">It belongs to him and Sam.</span>
<a name="l9239"><span class="ln">9239 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can.’ Sam’s mouth is dry.</span>
<a name="l9240"><span class="ln">9240 </span></a><span class="s0">She gives him a pair of thin gloves.</span>
<a name="l9241"><span class="ln">9241 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s not cold.</span>
<a name="l9242"><span class="ln">9242 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You just flip the off switch,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l9243"><span class="ln">9243 </span></a><span class="s0">Then unlock the back door.</span>
<a name="l9244"><span class="ln">9244 </span></a><span class="s0">Use your phone for light.</span>
<a name="l9245"><span class="ln">9245 </span></a><span class="s0">Easy, kid, so easy.</span>
<a name="l9246"><span class="ln">9246 </span></a><span class="s0">She tugs out her phone and frowns at the screen.</span>
<a name="l9247"><span class="ln">9247 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll take this.</span>
<a name="l9248"><span class="ln">9248 </span></a><span class="s0">You got it?’ Sam nods.</span>
<a name="l9249"><span class="ln">9249 </span></a><span class="s0">Even Sam winces.</span>
<a name="l9250"><span class="ln">9250 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t think about it now, Sammy.</span>
<a name="l9251"><span class="ln">9251 </span></a><span class="s0">Take a breath.</span>
<a name="l9252"><span class="ln">9252 </span></a><span class="s0">The building is tall and the window looks impossibly tiny.</span>
<a name="l9253"><span class="ln">9253 </span></a><span class="s0">He glances back.</span>
<a name="l9254"><span class="ln">9254 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin makes an angry flicking motion.</span>
<a name="l9255"><span class="ln">9255 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers crawl across bricks.</span>
<a name="l9256"><span class="ln">9256 </span></a><span class="s0">It shudders under his weight, but he just moves faster.</span>
<a name="l9257"><span class="ln">9257 </span></a><span class="s0">Fast, boy, go fast.</span>
<a name="l9258"><span class="ln">9258 </span></a><span class="s0">His heart crashes hard in his chest.</span>
<a name="l9259"><span class="ln">9259 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t look down.</span>
<a name="l9260"><span class="ln">9260 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t look for Vin.</span>
<a name="l9261"><span class="ln">9261 </span></a><span class="s0">After this, he gets Avery.</span>
<a name="l9262"><span class="ln">9262 </span></a><span class="s0">He gets to hide.</span>
<a name="l9263"><span class="ln">9263 </span></a><span class="s0">It crashes to the floor inside.</span>
<a name="l9264"><span class="ln">9264 </span></a><span class="s0">The sound is an explosion over the empty car park.</span>
<a name="l9265"><span class="ln">9265 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t see Vin.</span>
<a name="l9266"><span class="ln">9266 </span></a><span class="s0">His shoulders only just wedge through.</span>
<a name="l9267"><span class="ln">9267 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t think about falling.</span>
<a name="l9268"><span class="ln">9268 </span></a><span class="s0">He flips down, silent as death.</span>
<a name="l9269"><span class="ln">9269 </span></a><span class="s0">He walks the halls.</span>
<a name="l9270"><span class="ln">9270 </span></a><span class="s0">Avoids the cameras.</span>
<a name="l9271"><span class="ln">9271 </span></a><span class="s0">Gets to the back door.</span>
<a name="l9272"><span class="ln">9272 </span></a><span class="s0">He shuts down the light, the camera, the alarms.</span>
<a name="l9273"><span class="ln">9273 </span></a><span class="s0">Once he unlocks that door, this place is Vin’s.</span>
<a name="l9274"><span class="ln">9274 </span></a><span class="s0">This is real and it’s big.</span>
<a name="l9275"><span class="ln">9275 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers are red, a poisoned stain.</span>
<a name="l9276"><span class="ln">9276 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie screams ‘Sam’ in his ears.</span>
<a name="l9277"><span class="ln">9277 </span></a><span class="s0">Not angry – frightened, desperate.</span>
<a name="l9278"><span class="ln">9278 </span></a><span class="s0">He feels hot.</span>
<a name="l9279"><span class="ln">9279 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s going to throw up.</span>
<a name="l9280"><span class="ln">9280 </span></a><span class="s0">He slides down the wall, holding his face.</span>
<a name="l9281"><span class="ln">9281 </span></a><span class="s0">Tears spill between his fingers.</span>
<a name="l9282"><span class="ln">9282 </span></a><span class="s0">If he does this, it’s the beginning, not the end.</span>
<a name="l9283"><span class="ln">9283 </span></a><span class="s0">And he will never see Moxie again.</span>
<a name="l9284"><span class="ln">9284 </span></a><span class="s0">He did that himself.</span>
<a name="l9285"><span class="ln">9285 </span></a><span class="s0">The doorknob jiggles and then there’s an urgent hiss.</span>
<a name="l9286"><span class="ln">9286 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sammy.’ Sam hugs his legs tighter.</span>
<a name="l9287"><span class="ln">9287 </span></a><span class="s0">Are you there?</span>
<a name="l9288"><span class="ln">9288 </span></a><span class="s0">Won’t do it.</span>
<a name="l9289"><span class="ln">9289 </span></a><span class="s0">Can’t can’t can’t— The doorknob rattles again and Vin swears.</span>
<a name="l9290"><span class="ln">9290 </span></a><span class="s0">Open – this – door.’ Sam hits dial.</span>
<a name="l9291"><span class="ln">9291 </span></a><span class="s0">Emergency picks up.</span>
<a name="l9292"><span class="ln">9292 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Please,’ Sam whispers, giving the address of the art gallery.</span>
<a name="l9293"><span class="ln">9293 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s being robbed.</span>
<a name="l9294"><span class="ln">9294 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s out of time.</span>
<a name="l9295"><span class="ln">9295 </span></a><span class="s0">‘She’s going to kill me.’ He ends the call.</span>
<a name="l9296"><span class="ln">9296 </span></a><span class="s0">More than one set.</span>
<a name="l9297"><span class="ln">9297 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s heart skips a beat.</span>
<a name="l9298"><span class="ln">9298 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin’s is acid.</span>
<a name="l9299"><span class="ln">9299 </span></a><span class="s0">I had to come!</span>
<a name="l9300"><span class="ln">9300 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery can’t be here.</span>
<a name="l9301"><span class="ln">9301 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam just called the goddamn police.</span>
<a name="l9302"><span class="ln">9302 </span></a><span class="s0">He isn’t thinking.</span>
<a name="l9303"><span class="ln">9303 </span></a><span class="s0">Just let there have never been a Sammy Lou.</span>
<a name="l9304"><span class="ln">9304 </span></a><span class="s0">He leans his cheek against the cold door.</span>
<a name="l9305"><span class="ln">9305 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to get Avery out of here.</span>
<a name="l9306"><span class="ln">9306 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing else matters.</span>
<a name="l9307"><span class="ln">9307 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam flips the lock.</span>
<a name="l9308"><span class="ln">9308 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s voice is high and trembling.</span>
<a name="l9309"><span class="ln">9309 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Who would know—’ ‘The kid,’ Vin snaps.</span>
<a name="l9310"><span class="ln">9310 </span></a><span class="s0">‘The kid has a phone.</span>
<a name="l9311"><span class="ln">9311 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam doesn’t stop.</span>
<a name="l9312"><span class="ln">9312 </span></a><span class="s0">Blue and red lights flash on the street.</span>
<a name="l9313"><span class="ln">9313 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Run!’ Vin gasps and pelts after Sam.</span>
<a name="l9314"><span class="ln">9314 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s a brief hesitation and then Avery takes off too.</span>
<a name="l9315"><span class="ln">9315 </span></a><span class="s0">They pound after him.</span>
<a name="l9316"><span class="ln">9316 </span></a><span class="s0">Chasing him or just getting away?</span>
<a name="l9317"><span class="ln">9317 </span></a><span class="s0">His lungs scream.</span>
<a name="l9318"><span class="ln">9318 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam hits the ground and keeps running.</span>
<a name="l9319"><span class="ln">9319 </span></a><span class="s0">But Avery trips.</span>
<a name="l9320"><span class="ln">9320 </span></a><span class="s0">And then Vin is on top of him.</span>
<a name="l9321"><span class="ln">9321 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin has Avery’s arm.</span>
<a name="l9322"><span class="ln">9322 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You dropped the bag of money, didn’t you?’ Vin says.</span>
<a name="l9323"><span class="ln">9323 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Our whole night’s work.’ She throws Avery on the ground.</span>
<a name="l9324"><span class="ln">9324 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam takes a step forward.</span>
<a name="l9325"><span class="ln">9325 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin’s lips peel back in a vicious smile.</span>
<a name="l9326"><span class="ln">9326 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s cry cuts the numb walls around Sam.</span>
<a name="l9327"><span class="ln">9327 </span></a><span class="s0">Red heat pours into Sam’s eyes.</span>
<a name="l9328"><span class="ln">9328 </span></a><span class="s0">He sags to his knees, hands to his head.</span>
<a name="l9329"><span class="ln">9329 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin picks something up from the piles of alley rubbish.</span>
<a name="l9330"><span class="ln">9330 </span></a><span class="s0">A broken piece of plywood spiked with bent rusted nails.</span>
<a name="l9331"><span class="ln">9331 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery scrabbles to get up.</span>
<a name="l9332"><span class="ln">9332 </span></a><span class="s0">I-I-I—’ Vin cracks the pole across Avery’s stomach.</span>
<a name="l9333"><span class="ln">9333 </span></a><span class="s0">He falls back down with a cry.</span>
<a name="l9334"><span class="ln">9334 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs it to stop spinning, please stop spinning.</span>
<a name="l9335"><span class="ln">9335 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re next, Sammy.</span>
<a name="l9336"><span class="ln">9336 </span></a><span class="s0">It catches Avery across the shoulder blades with sickening thwack.</span>
<a name="l9337"><span class="ln">9337 </span></a><span class="s0">He never runs.</span>
<a name="l9338"><span class="ln">9338 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam leaps forward.</span>
<a name="l9339"><span class="ln">9339 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s sob is broken.</span>
<a name="l9340"><span class="ln">9340 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s cry is blood.</span>
<a name="l9341"><span class="ln">9341 </span></a><span class="s0">She lands a punch on Sam’s jaw.</span>
<a name="l9342"><span class="ln">9342 </span></a><span class="s0">He raises his fist to her face.</span>
<a name="l9343"><span class="ln">9343 </span></a><span class="s0">Twice in one night his soul spills red.</span>
<a name="l9344"><span class="ln">9344 </span></a><span class="s0">But he can’t do this.</span>
<a name="l9345"><span class="ln">9345 </span></a><span class="s0">A sob ravages Sam’s chest.</span>
<a name="l9346"><span class="ln">9346 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t want to do this any more.</span>
<a name="l9347"><span class="ln">9347 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin’s fingers claw at Sam’s waistcoat.</span>
<a name="l9348"><span class="ln">9348 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not going to hit any more.</span>
<a name="l9349"><span class="ln">9349 </span></a><span class="s0">His world shudders.</span>
<a name="l9350"><span class="ln">9350 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks down.</span>
<a name="l9351"><span class="ln">9351 </span></a><span class="s0">He opens his mouth.</span>
<a name="l9352"><span class="ln">9352 </span></a><span class="s0">One bright spear of pain.</span>
<a name="l9353"><span class="ln">9353 </span></a><span class="s0">Behind him, Avery wails.</span>
<a name="l9354"><span class="ln">9354 </span></a><span class="s0">High-pitched and childish and terrified.</span>
<a name="l9355"><span class="ln">9355 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin drops into a crouch in front of Sam.</span>
<a name="l9356"><span class="ln">9356 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin’s face fills his whole vision.</span>
<a name="l9357"><span class="ln">9357 </span></a><span class="s0">He falls for ever.</span>
<a name="l9358"><span class="ln">9358 </span></a><span class="s0">He is going to die.</span>
<a name="l9359"><span class="ln">9359 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery catches his head before he hits the cement.</span>
<a name="l9360"><span class="ln">9360 </span></a><span class="s0">It runs thick and red.</span>
<a name="l9361"><span class="ln">9361 </span></a><span class="s0">So much of it.</span>
<a name="l9362"><span class="ln">9362 </span></a><span class="s0">It doesn’t really hurt.</span>
<a name="l9363"><span class="ln">9363 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam tries to tell Avery that.</span>
<a name="l9364"><span class="ln">9364 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t cry, Avery.</span>
<a name="l9365"><span class="ln">9365 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I n-n-need you.</span>
<a name="l9366"><span class="ln">9366 </span></a><span class="s0">You c-c-can’t …’ His voice breaks.</span>
<a name="l9367"><span class="ln">9367 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Avery.’ Sam’s fist curls in Avery’s shirt.</span>
<a name="l9368"><span class="ln">9368 </span></a><span class="s0">The alley is quiet.</span>
<a name="l9369"><span class="ln">9369 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin is gone.</span>
<a name="l9370"><span class="ln">9370 </span></a><span class="s0">His stims get tangled when he’s upset.</span>
<a name="l9371"><span class="ln">9371 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam is so very good at making people upset.</span>
<a name="l9372"><span class="ln">9372 </span></a><span class="s0">No one hears.</span>
<a name="l9373"><span class="ln">9373 </span></a><span class="s0">No one comes.</span>
<a name="l9374"><span class="ln">9374 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam tries to cough but it hurts too much.</span>
<a name="l9375"><span class="ln">9375 </span></a><span class="s0">The pain is here, finally.</span>
<a name="l9376"><span class="ln">9376 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll buy you a hundred houses.</span>
<a name="l9377"><span class="ln">9377 </span></a><span class="s0">I swear, I’ll do a-a-a-anything.</span>
<a name="l9378"><span class="ln">9378 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t leave.’ But Avery’s already letting go.</span>
<a name="l9379"><span class="ln">9379 </span></a><span class="s0">Then it’s quiet.</span>
<a name="l9380"><span class="ln">9380 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam tries to put the pieces of himself together.</span>
<a name="l9381"><span class="ln">9381 </span></a><span class="s0">Tries, with cotton and screws and wishes.</span>
<a name="l9382"><span class="ln">9382 </span></a><span class="s0">But doesn’t he deserve this?</span>
<a name="l9383"><span class="ln">9383 </span></a><span class="s0">His ribs folds inwards as everything inside him shudders.</span>
<a name="l9384"><span class="ln">9384 </span></a><span class="s0">The boy turns invisible.</span>
<a name="l9385"><span class="ln">9385 </span></a><span class="s0">As he should be.</span>
<a name="l9386"><span class="ln">9386 </span></a><span class="s0">They try to pry his fingers open.</span>
<a name="l9387"><span class="ln">9387 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s too weak to stop them.</span>
<a name="l9388"><span class="ln">9388 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No, wait!’ Avery’s voice is panicked, words tripping over themselves.</span>
<a name="l9389"><span class="ln">9389 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t take it.</span>
<a name="l9390"><span class="ln">9390 </span></a><span class="s0">We’ve got this.</span>
<a name="l9391"><span class="ln">9391 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs it!</span>
<a name="l9392"><span class="ln">9392 </span></a><span class="s0">Listen to me, listen, just—’ They leave Sam’s fingers alone.</span>
<a name="l9393"><span class="ln">9393 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What’s he holding anyway?’ ‘A key.</span>
<a name="l9394"><span class="ln">9394 </span></a><span class="s0">They need to understand the key.</span>
<a name="l9395"><span class="ln">9395 </span></a><span class="s0">If lost, please return to the De Laineys.</span>
<a name="l9396"><span class="ln">9396 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy is fourteen and full of broken pieces.</span>
<a name="l9397"><span class="ln">9397 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s been here for a long time.</span>
<a name="l9398"><span class="ln">9398 </span></a><span class="s0">If he goes in, she’ll call the cops.</span>
<a name="l9399"><span class="ln">9399 </span></a><span class="s0">After what he did to those boys at school.</span>
<a name="l9400"><span class="ln">9400 </span></a><span class="s0">Or maybe that’s the wind.</span>
<a name="l9401"><span class="ln">9401 </span></a><span class="s0">Or maybe that’s him.</span>
<a name="l9402"><span class="ln">9402 </span></a><span class="s0">Being smashed to pieces.</span>
<a name="l9403"><span class="ln">9403 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood and broken bone and hollowed-out eyes.</span>
<a name="l9404"><span class="ln">9404 </span></a><span class="s0">And the screaming.</span>
<a name="l9405"><span class="ln">9405 </span></a><span class="s0">When they catch Sammy, they’ll take him away.</span>
<a name="l9406"><span class="ln">9406 </span></a><span class="s0">He deserves it.</span>
<a name="l9407"><span class="ln">9407 </span></a><span class="s0">He always goes too far.</span>
<a name="l9408"><span class="ln">9408 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll die in prison.</span>
<a name="l9409"><span class="ln">9409 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll die without Avery.</span>
<a name="l9410"><span class="ln">9410 </span></a><span class="s0">The curtain rips back and Avery’s there, eyes melting pools.</span>
<a name="l9411"><span class="ln">9411 </span></a><span class="s0">‘C-c-can you get my jumper?’ Sammy whispers.</span>
<a name="l9412"><span class="ln">9412 </span></a><span class="s0">The curtain falls and there’s a brief scuffling.</span>
<a name="l9413"><span class="ln">9413 </span></a><span class="s0">‘If Sammy’s there, I’m calling the cops!’ she shouts.</span>
<a name="l9414"><span class="ln">9414 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Come back inside, Avery.</span>
<a name="l9415"><span class="ln">9415 </span></a><span class="s0">You’ll get your cast wet.</span>
<a name="l9416"><span class="ln">9416 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sammy.’ It’s a sob.</span>
<a name="l9417"><span class="ln">9417 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey.’ Sam clutches him, a drowning boy.</span>
<a name="l9418"><span class="ln">9418 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey – h-hey, you’ll get your cast wet.</span>
<a name="l9419"><span class="ln">9419 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s only just out of hospital.</span>
<a name="l9420"><span class="ln">9420 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can’t.’ Sam glances desperately at the door.</span>
<a name="l9421"><span class="ln">9421 </span></a><span class="s0">Has she called the cops already?</span>
<a name="l9422"><span class="ln">9422 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m going to … I’m running away.’ ‘OK,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l9423"><span class="ln">9423 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I won’t have anywhere to live.</span>
<a name="l9424"><span class="ln">9424 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll … I’ll steal.</span>
<a name="l9425"><span class="ln">9425 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll steal houses.</span>
<a name="l9426"><span class="ln">9426 </span></a><span class="s0">Tears and rain.</span>
<a name="l9427"><span class="ln">9427 </span></a><span class="s0">And me,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l9428"><span class="ln">9428 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We.’ He’s too soft, they always said.</span>
<a name="l9429"><span class="ln">9429 </span></a><span class="s0">He shifts on the pillows, his eyelids swollen and sticky.</span>
<a name="l9430"><span class="ln">9430 </span></a><span class="s0">A chair scrapes.</span>
<a name="l9431"><span class="ln">9431 </span></a><span class="s0">Sheets rustle as elbows leans forward.</span>
<a name="l9432"><span class="ln">9432 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers fold over it automatically.</span>
<a name="l9433"><span class="ln">9433 </span></a><span class="s0">‘They took it off you during surgery.</span>
<a name="l9434"><span class="ln">9434 </span></a><span class="s0">But you have it back now.</span>
<a name="l9435"><span class="ln">9435 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s OK, Sammy.’ Sam drags his eyes open.</span>
<a name="l9436"><span class="ln">9436 </span></a><span class="s0">His face feels stung and swollen, his throat flayed raw.</span>
<a name="l9437"><span class="ln">9437 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks terrible.</span>
<a name="l9438"><span class="ln">9438 </span></a><span class="s0">His clothes are gone.</span>
<a name="l9439"><span class="ln">9439 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie’s waistcoat is gone.</span>
<a name="l9440"><span class="ln">9440 </span></a><span class="s0">He ruined it.</span>
<a name="l9441"><span class="ln">9441 </span></a><span class="s0">All her work.</span>
<a name="l9442"><span class="ln">9442 </span></a><span class="s0">She’ll yell at him for six days solid for— Oh.</span>
<a name="l9443"><span class="ln">9443 </span></a><span class="s0">There is no more Moxie.</span>
<a name="l9444"><span class="ln">9444 </span></a><span class="s0">There will be no more Moxie.</span>
<a name="l9445"><span class="ln">9445 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants Avery to deny it.</span>
<a name="l9446"><span class="ln">9446 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Yeah,’ says Avery, voice thick.</span>
<a name="l9447"><span class="ln">9447 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sorry, Sammy.</span>
<a name="l9448"><span class="ln">9448 </span></a><span class="s0">I-I-I had to tell them everything.’ Oh.</span>
<a name="l9449"><span class="ln">9449 </span></a><span class="s0">But he just feels numb.</span>
<a name="l9450"><span class="ln">9450 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You had stitches,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l9451"><span class="ln">9451 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But it went in deep so … surgery.</span>
<a name="l9452"><span class="ln">9452 </span></a><span class="s0">It took a while.</span>
<a name="l9453"><span class="ln">9453 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m supposed to get the nurse when you wake up.</span>
<a name="l9454"><span class="ln">9454 </span></a><span class="s0">Do you hurt?</span>
<a name="l9455"><span class="ln">9455 </span></a><span class="s0">How bad?’ Bad.</span>
<a name="l9456"><span class="ln">9456 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m OK.’ Sam closes his eyes.</span>
<a name="l9457"><span class="ln">9457 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam puts a hand on Avery’s head.</span>
<a name="l9458"><span class="ln">9458 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I don’t think so.</span>
<a name="l9459"><span class="ln">9459 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery scrubs his eyes with the hem of his T-shirt.</span>
<a name="l9460"><span class="ln">9460 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sammy, what was I supposed to do?</span>
<a name="l9461"><span class="ln">9461 </span></a><span class="s0">I couldn’t let you die.’ He’s going to jail.</span>
<a name="l9462"><span class="ln">9462 </span></a><span class="s0">A small part of his heart is glad.</span>
<a name="l9463"><span class="ln">9463 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so tired.</span>
<a name="l9464"><span class="ln">9464 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy – I can’t.</span>
<a name="l9465"><span class="ln">9465 </span></a><span class="s0">I need you.</span>
<a name="l9466"><span class="ln">9466 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I lied when I said I didn’t.</span>
<a name="l9467"><span class="ln">9467 </span></a><span class="s0">You know that, right?</span>
<a name="l9468"><span class="ln">9468 </span></a><span class="s0">I LIED —’ ‘Hey, hey, shh.</span>
<a name="l9469"><span class="ln">9469 </span></a><span class="s0">I know.’ Sam stretches out his fingers, brushing Avery’s wrist.</span>
<a name="l9470"><span class="ln">9470 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Have you slept?’ Avery shakes his head, whole body trembling.</span>
<a name="l9471"><span class="ln">9471 </span></a><span class="s0">‘My hands are going like a psycho,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l9472"><span class="ln">9472 </span></a><span class="s0">You need to move.</span>
<a name="l9473"><span class="ln">9473 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s OK.’ Avery whimpers.</span>
<a name="l9474"><span class="ln">9474 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Is this OK?’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l9475"><span class="ln">9475 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can move.’ ‘Don’t leave.’ ‘I’m not leaving.</span>
<a name="l9476"><span class="ln">9476 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m not leaving,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l9477"><span class="ln">9477 </span></a><span class="s0">The trick is to keep quiet.</span>
<a name="l9478"><span class="ln">9478 </span></a><span class="s0">The trick is to hold on to Avery.</span>
<a name="l9479"><span class="ln">9479 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s the falling.</span>
<a name="l9480"><span class="ln">9480 </span></a><span class="s0">Sometimes he can’t take a deep enough breath.</span>
<a name="l9481"><span class="ln">9481 </span></a><span class="s0">He won’t eat.</span>
<a name="l9482"><span class="ln">9482 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s been twenty-four hours, and he’s so, so sore.</span>
<a name="l9483"><span class="ln">9483 </span></a><span class="s0">It just slips back down.</span>
<a name="l9484"><span class="ln">9484 </span></a><span class="s0">They don’t want to see him as a child.</span>
<a name="l9485"><span class="ln">9485 </span></a><span class="s0">He curls tighter into a ball.</span>
<a name="l9486"><span class="ln">9486 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Excuse me, but you can’t be in here.’ Sam tenses.</span>
<a name="l9487"><span class="ln">9487 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But it says family, right?</span>
<a name="l9488"><span class="ln">9488 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m family.’ ‘Uh.</span>
<a name="l9489"><span class="ln">9489 </span></a><span class="s0">You look nothing like—’ ‘Oh, just five minutes.</span>
<a name="l9490"><span class="ln">9490 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ve run across the entire city to find him.</span>
<a name="l9491"><span class="ln">9491 </span></a><span class="s0">Let me see her.</span>
<a name="l9492"><span class="ln">9492 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s a fist to Sam’s already pulverised stomach.</span>
<a name="l9493"><span class="ln">9493 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How could you?’ He shrinks against the pillows.</span>
<a name="l9494"><span class="ln">9494 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What you did?</span>
<a name="l9495"><span class="ln">9495 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s you—’ She stops.</span>
<a name="l9496"><span class="ln">9496 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s you who’s the monster.</span>
<a name="l9497"><span class="ln">9497 </span></a><span class="s0">An ocean away.</span>
<a name="l9498"><span class="ln">9498 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We looked everywhere.</span>
<a name="l9499"><span class="ln">9499 </span></a><span class="s0">She lays her hands in her lap.</span>
<a name="l9500"><span class="ln">9500 </span></a><span class="s0">Doesn’t look at him.</span>
<a name="l9501"><span class="ln">9501 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I told my dad everything.</span>
<a name="l9502"><span class="ln">9502 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants to curl under it completely, disappear.</span>
<a name="l9503"><span class="ln">9503 </span></a><span class="s0">Her voice is tight.</span>
<a name="l9504"><span class="ln">9504 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dad said he could’ve helped.’ Too late now.</span>
<a name="l9505"><span class="ln">9505 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He couldn’t.’ Sam’s heart punches holes in his chest.</span>
<a name="l9506"><span class="ln">9506 </span></a><span class="s0">And you don’t deserve to be caught?</span>
<a name="l9507"><span class="ln">9507 </span></a><span class="s0">Look what he did.</span>
<a name="l9508"><span class="ln">9508 </span></a><span class="s0">Look at his hands.</span>
<a name="l9509"><span class="ln">9509 </span></a><span class="s0">She slips a phone from her pocket.</span>
<a name="l9510"><span class="ln">9510 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s mouth is cotton and ash.</span>
<a name="l9511"><span class="ln">9511 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Just leave it, OK?</span>
<a name="l9512"><span class="ln">9512 </span></a><span class="s0">All waif and damp eyes and fluttering fingers.</span>
<a name="l9513"><span class="ln">9513 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And your brother?’ Moxie says, stiff now.</span>
<a name="l9514"><span class="ln">9514 </span></a><span class="s0">How is he going to help you?</span>
<a name="l9515"><span class="ln">9515 </span></a><span class="s0">You said he needs help.’ He does.</span>
<a name="l9516"><span class="ln">9516 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’ll be fine.’ Sam rubs his knuckles over his eyes.</span>
<a name="l9517"><span class="ln">9517 </span></a><span class="s0">But at least she didn’t call anyone.</span>
<a name="l9518"><span class="ln">9518 </span></a><span class="s0">And then … then what even happened?’ Sam feels sick.</span>
<a name="l9519"><span class="ln">9519 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I got stabbed.’ Moxie’s eyes widen.</span>
<a name="l9520"><span class="ln">9520 </span></a><span class="s0">But she doesn’t.</span>
<a name="l9521"><span class="ln">9521 </span></a><span class="s0">By who?’ Sam closes his eyes.</span>
<a name="l9522"><span class="ln">9522 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Someone who hit Avery.’ Sam rubs his eyes again.</span>
<a name="l9523"><span class="ln">9523 </span></a><span class="s0">They keep filling up.</span>
<a name="l9524"><span class="ln">9524 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so soft.</span>
<a name="l9525"><span class="ln">9525 </span></a><span class="s0">The trick is to not be so soft.</span>
<a name="l9526"><span class="ln">9526 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sorry,’ he whispers.</span>
<a name="l9527"><span class="ln">9527 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m so so sorry.’ Moxie backhands her eyes furiously.</span>
<a name="l9528"><span class="ln">9528 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I know Griffin hit you first.</span>
<a name="l9529"><span class="ln">9529 </span></a><span class="s0">But … Sam, you scare me.’ He scares Avery too.</span>
<a name="l9530"><span class="ln">9530 </span></a><span class="s0">He scares himself.</span>
<a name="l9531"><span class="ln">9531 </span></a><span class="s0">I want to stop, he could scream.</span>
<a name="l9532"><span class="ln">9532 </span></a><span class="s0">I don’t want this to be my forever.</span>
<a name="l9533"><span class="ln">9533 </span></a><span class="s0">This is infinitely worse.</span>
<a name="l9534"><span class="ln">9534 </span></a><span class="s0">And even then, would it be enough?</span>
<a name="l9535"><span class="ln">9535 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s insides turn to ice.</span>
<a name="l9536"><span class="ln">9536 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie pushes sweaty hair out of her eyes.</span>
<a name="l9537"><span class="ln">9537 </span></a><span class="s0">She turns to the social worker.</span>
<a name="l9538"><span class="ln">9538 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No visitors for my client.</span>
<a name="l9539"><span class="ln">9539 </span></a><span class="s0">Have the hospital staff notified.</span>
<a name="l9540"><span class="ln">9540 </span></a><span class="s0">She mouths, Let me help.</span>
<a name="l9541"><span class="ln">9541 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam gives the tiniest shake of his head.</span>
<a name="l9542"><span class="ln">9542 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam bunches his fists in the blankets.</span>
<a name="l9543"><span class="ln">9543 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs Avery.</span>
<a name="l9544"><span class="ln">9544 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re not going to let him have Avery.</span>
<a name="l9545"><span class="ln">9545 </span></a><span class="s0">The social worker holds out his hand to shake Sam’s.</span>
<a name="l9546"><span class="ln">9546 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Emery Evans,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l9547"><span class="ln">9547 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And this is your lawyer, Celia Polnik.</span>
<a name="l9548"><span class="ln">9548 </span></a><span class="s0">He has no words.</span>
<a name="l9549"><span class="ln">9549 </span></a><span class="s0">Can’t they see?</span>
<a name="l9550"><span class="ln">9550 </span></a><span class="s0">His thin chest moves raggedly.</span>
<a name="l9551"><span class="ln">9551 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe a girl woke him on her way out.</span>
<a name="l9552"><span class="ln">9552 </span></a><span class="s0">‘OK,’ Avery says, ‘OK, I’m here.</span>
<a name="l9553"><span class="ln">9553 </span></a><span class="s0">Possibly a nap.</span>
<a name="l9554"><span class="ln">9554 </span></a><span class="s0">Possibly he could never wake up.</span>
<a name="l9555"><span class="ln">9555 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers brush over the bandages taped to his stomach.</span>
<a name="l9556"><span class="ln">9556 </span></a><span class="s0">Or how often he screams himself awake at night.</span>
<a name="l9557"><span class="ln">9557 </span></a><span class="s0">No one knows what to do with him.</span>
<a name="l9558"><span class="ln">9558 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery, so far, slips through the cracks of everyone’s attention.</span>
<a name="l9559"><span class="ln">9559 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam pulls himself upright.</span>
<a name="l9560"><span class="ln">9560 </span></a><span class="s0">He seems satisfied.</span>
<a name="l9561"><span class="ln">9561 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Get your shirt.</span>
<a name="l9562"><span class="ln">9562 </span></a><span class="s0">Evans brought the clothes in earlier.</span>
<a name="l9563"><span class="ln">9563 </span></a><span class="s0">Ruined with blood and sliced by the knife.</span>
<a name="l9564"><span class="ln">9564 </span></a><span class="s0">They threw it out.</span>
<a name="l9565"><span class="ln">9565 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t think of the waistcoat.</span>
<a name="l9566"><span class="ln">9566 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re not allowed.</span>
<a name="l9567"><span class="ln">9567 </span></a><span class="s0">You don’t deserve to.</span>
<a name="l9568"><span class="ln">9568 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Avery isn’t back yet,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l9569"><span class="ln">9569 </span></a><span class="s0">The man is all spider-thin fingers and a disapproving mouth.</span>
<a name="l9570"><span class="ln">9570 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He might not make it in time.</span>
<a name="l9571"><span class="ln">9571 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’re not waiting.’ Sam understands.</span>
<a name="l9572"><span class="ln">9572 </span></a><span class="s0">Evans did this on purpose.</span>
<a name="l9573"><span class="ln">9573 </span></a><span class="s0">When Avery’s sleeping.</span>
<a name="l9574"><span class="ln">9574 </span></a><span class="s0">When Avery’s gone to try and find Aunt Karen.</span>
<a name="l9575"><span class="ln">9575 </span></a><span class="s0">Then his spider fingers will be all over Sam’s brother.</span>
<a name="l9576"><span class="ln">9576 </span></a><span class="s0">But he doesn’t want Avery at the courthouse.</span>
<a name="l9577"><span class="ln">9577 </span></a><span class="s0">But Sam can’t go without him.</span>
<a name="l9578"><span class="ln">9578 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so empty.</span>
<a name="l9579"><span class="ln">9579 </span></a><span class="s0">Stars and buttons and caramel truffles.</span>
<a name="l9580"><span class="ln">9580 </span></a><span class="s0">Locked from the outside.</span>
<a name="l9581"><span class="ln">9581 </span></a><span class="s0">Evans’s car purrs smoothly through the city.</span>
<a name="l9582"><span class="ln">9582 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Am I going to jail?’ Sam says at last.</span>
<a name="l9583"><span class="ln">9583 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can’t predict the judge.’ A non-answer.</span>
<a name="l9584"><span class="ln">9584 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam should be used to those.</span>
<a name="l9585"><span class="ln">9585 </span></a><span class="s0">Evans doesn’t notice.</span>
<a name="l9586"><span class="ln">9586 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You will eventually.</span>
<a name="l9587"><span class="ln">9587 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s ripping apart.</span>
<a name="l9588"><span class="ln">9588 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I need air,’ he whispers.</span>
<a name="l9589"><span class="ln">9589 </span></a><span class="s0">Then louder, ‘I need the window down.</span>
<a name="l9590"><span class="ln">9590 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam unbuckles his belt and puts his whole head out.</span>
<a name="l9591"><span class="ln">9591 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sit back down,’ Evans commands.</span>
<a name="l9592"><span class="ln">9592 </span></a><span class="s0">Evans yells at his back.</span>
<a name="l9593"><span class="ln">9593 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You can’t afford to do this!’ Evan shouts.</span>
<a name="l9594"><span class="ln">9594 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam tucks his head and swerves amongst cars.</span>
<a name="l9595"><span class="ln">9595 </span></a><span class="s0">His shoes hit the sidewalk.</span>
<a name="l9596"><span class="ln">9596 </span></a><span class="s0">You have to get out of here.</span>
<a name="l9597"><span class="ln">9597 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood blooms across the white like spilt paint.</span>
<a name="l9598"><span class="ln">9598 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s good at running away.</span>
<a name="l9599"><span class="ln">9599 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like ripping stitches.</span>
<a name="l9600"><span class="ln">9600 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like the knife going in again and again.</span>
<a name="l9601"><span class="ln">9601 </span></a><span class="s0">He throws his tie away.</span>
<a name="l9602"><span class="ln">9602 </span></a><span class="s0">His legs know the destination even before his mind does.</span>
<a name="l9603"><span class="ln">9603 </span></a><span class="s0">Walk, Sammy, just walk.</span>
<a name="l9604"><span class="ln">9604 </span></a><span class="s0">They said they would help.</span>
<a name="l9605"><span class="ln">9605 </span></a><span class="s0">The sun bathes the world in dusky blues and pinks.</span>
<a name="l9606"><span class="ln">9606 </span></a><span class="s0">He slumps into the gutter in front of the house.</span>
<a name="l9607"><span class="ln">9607 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s late enough that everyone will be home.</span>
<a name="l9608"><span class="ln">9608 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy is probably cooking – it’s his night, isn’t it?</span>
<a name="l9609"><span class="ln">9609 </span></a><span class="s0">Toby is probably drawing on a wall.</span>
<a name="l9610"><span class="ln">9610 </span></a><span class="s0">Grady is reading and bossing everyone around.</span>
<a name="l9611"><span class="ln">9611 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie is Moxie is Moxie is Moxie hates him.</span>
<a name="l9612"><span class="ln">9612 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam rests his face on his knees.</span>
<a name="l9613"><span class="ln">9613 </span></a><span class="s0">This house will never be his.</span>
<a name="l9614"><span class="ln">9614 </span></a><span class="s0">It tastes of cooler days and the end of summer.</span>
<a name="l9615"><span class="ln">9615 </span></a><span class="s0">It had to end.</span>
<a name="l9616"><span class="ln">9616 </span></a><span class="s0">Boots hit the footpath behind him.</span>
<a name="l9617"><span class="ln">9617 </span></a><span class="s0">He keeps his face pressed in his knees.</span>
<a name="l9618"><span class="ln">9618 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sam.’ The voice is softness and sorrow.</span>
<a name="l9619"><span class="ln">9619 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr De Lainey drops down into the gutter beside Sam.</span>
<a name="l9620"><span class="ln">9620 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t touch him.</span>
<a name="l9621"><span class="ln">9621 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t look at his face.</span>
<a name="l9622"><span class="ln">9622 </span></a><span class="s0">He never wanted those disappointed eyes on him.</span>
<a name="l9623"><span class="ln">9623 </span></a><span class="s0">Why did Sam come back?</span>
<a name="l9624"><span class="ln">9624 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re lying.’ Sam shrinks into himself a little further.</span>
<a name="l9625"><span class="ln">9625 </span></a><span class="s0">But Mr De Lainey’s voice isn’t angry.</span>
<a name="l9626"><span class="ln">9626 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I know you’re looking for something, Sam,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l9627"><span class="ln">9627 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I know you found it here.</span>
<a name="l9628"><span class="ln">9628 </span></a><span class="s0">‘A family.’ His voice dries in his throat.</span>
<a name="l9629"><span class="ln">9629 </span></a><span class="s0">I know I know I know.</span>
<a name="l9630"><span class="ln">9630 </span></a><span class="s0">But the gaze before him is just sad and tired.</span>
<a name="l9631"><span class="ln">9631 </span></a><span class="s0">No more hiding and running.</span>
<a name="l9632"><span class="ln">9632 </span></a><span class="s0">You need help, real help.</span>
<a name="l9633"><span class="ln">9633 </span></a><span class="s0">They stay like that for a minute or a year.</span>
<a name="l9634"><span class="ln">9634 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And then you can let me know what we’re doing.</span>
<a name="l9635"><span class="ln">9635 </span></a><span class="s0">I won’t stop you if you leave.</span>
<a name="l9636"><span class="ln">9636 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I don’t want to go in,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l9637"><span class="ln">9637 </span></a><span class="s0">The sewing machine shuts off.</span>
<a name="l9638"><span class="ln">9638 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam takes a step towards the window.</span>
<a name="l9639"><span class="ln">9639 </span></a><span class="s0">He raises a trembling hand and taps the glass.</span>
<a name="l9640"><span class="ln">9640 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie looks up.</span>
<a name="l9641"><span class="ln">9641 </span></a><span class="s0">Her hair is caught in a frizzy bun.</span>
<a name="l9642"><span class="ln">9642 </span></a><span class="s0">A scowl fits over her lips, all vinegar and suspicion.</span>
<a name="l9643"><span class="ln">9643 </span></a><span class="s0">When she sees him, the scowl falters.</span>
<a name="l9644"><span class="ln">9644 </span></a><span class="s0">Her lips part in surprise.</span>
<a name="l9645"><span class="ln">9645 </span></a><span class="s0">He pushes away from the window.</span>
<a name="l9646"><span class="ln">9646 </span></a><span class="s0">He deserves that.</span>
<a name="l9647"><span class="ln">9647 </span></a><span class="s0">All of it.</span>
<a name="l9648"><span class="ln">9648 </span></a><span class="s0">He should just walk away now.</span>
<a name="l9649"><span class="ln">9649 </span></a><span class="s0">Steal another house.</span>
<a name="l9650"><span class="ln">9650 </span></a><span class="s0">But he doesn’t doesn’t doesn’t want to.</span>
<a name="l9651"><span class="ln">9651 </span></a><span class="s0">Something like fear.</span>
<a name="l9652"><span class="ln">9652 </span></a><span class="s0">She doesn’t walk to him, she flies.</span>
<a name="l9653"><span class="ln">9653 </span></a><span class="s0">He expects a slap.</span>
<a name="l9654"><span class="ln">9654 </span></a><span class="s0">And she hugs him.</span>
<a name="l9655"><span class="ln">9655 </span></a><span class="s0">His arms slip around her back.</span>
<a name="l9656"><span class="ln">9656 </span></a><span class="s0">She is endlessly warm, like hugging waffles with honey.</span>
<a name="l9657"><span class="ln">9657 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m angry,’ she says fiercely.</span>
<a name="l9658"><span class="ln">9658 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m angry at you but I also care so much.</span>
<a name="l9659"><span class="ln">9659 </span></a><span class="s0">I told you that, didn’t I?</span>
<a name="l9660"><span class="ln">9660 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How dare you get stabbed?’ ‘I’m nothing,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l9661"><span class="ln">9661 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sorry.’ She glances down then and sees his shirt.</span>
<a name="l9662"><span class="ln">9662 </span></a><span class="s0">She gives a sharp intake of breath.</span>
<a name="l9663"><span class="ln">9663 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You stupid beautiful boy.</span>
<a name="l9664"><span class="ln">9664 </span></a><span class="s0">Go sit on the steps.</span>
<a name="l9665"><span class="ln">9665 </span></a><span class="s0">Right now.’ Then she spins and runs inside.</span>
<a name="l9666"><span class="ln">9666 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam does as he’s told.</span>
<a name="l9667"><span class="ln">9667 </span></a><span class="s0">Then she unbuttons Sam’s shirt.</span>
<a name="l9668"><span class="ln">9668 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood soaks her fingertips.</span>
<a name="l9669"><span class="ln">9669 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so cold.</span>
<a name="l9670"><span class="ln">9670 </span></a><span class="s0">He gets stuck lifting his arms high enough.</span>
<a name="l9671"><span class="ln">9671 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s Jeremy’s shirt, a superhero emblazoned on the front.</span>
<a name="l9672"><span class="ln">9672 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sor—’ ‘No, don’t say sorry again.</span>
<a name="l9673"><span class="ln">9673 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m not Goldilocks.</span>
<a name="l9674"><span class="ln">9674 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m the monster in the woods.</span>
<a name="l9675"><span class="ln">9675 </span></a><span class="s0">I can’t stop myself.</span>
<a name="l9676"><span class="ln">9676 </span></a><span class="s0">And I don’t like it … I hate it.</span>
<a name="l9677"><span class="ln">9677 </span></a><span class="s0">I hate it.</span>
<a name="l9678"><span class="ln">9678 </span></a><span class="s0">I deserve jail.</span>
<a name="l9679"><span class="ln">9679 </span></a><span class="s0">She takes his hands and their fingers fit together.</span>
<a name="l9680"><span class="ln">9680 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s so, so unfair.</span>
<a name="l9681"><span class="ln">9681 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s salty tears and bloody memories and empty boxes.</span>
<a name="l9682"><span class="ln">9682 </span></a><span class="s0">She tastes of longing, he of tears.</span>
<a name="l9683"><span class="ln">9683 </span></a><span class="s0">Her eyes are wet when she smiles.</span>
<a name="l9684"><span class="ln">9684 </span></a><span class="s0">They look up.</span>
<a name="l9685"><span class="ln">9685 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sammy.’ He gasps for breath.</span>
<a name="l9686"><span class="ln">9686 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And you’re just kissing – in the sunset?</span>
<a name="l9687"><span class="ln">9687 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy squeezes past the others on to the veranda.</span>
<a name="l9688"><span class="ln">9688 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey, the return of the second Sammy.’ He nudges Jack.</span>
<a name="l9689"><span class="ln">9689 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He looks like a wild sort of elf.</span>
<a name="l9690"><span class="ln">9690 </span></a><span class="s0">A lost boy from Peter Pan.’ Jack snorts.</span>
<a name="l9691"><span class="ln">9691 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I think he swam here.’ ‘I ran,’ Avery growls.</span>
<a name="l9692"><span class="ln">9692 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery seems to have regained his breath.</span>
<a name="l9693"><span class="ln">9693 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And then Sam’s deciding if he’s going back or not.</span>
<a name="l9694"><span class="ln">9694 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam snaps his gaze to Mr De Lainey.</span>
<a name="l9695"><span class="ln">9695 </span></a><span class="s0">What is he doing?</span>
<a name="l9696"><span class="ln">9696 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I work in construction,’ Mr De Lainey says.</span>
<a name="l9697"><span class="ln">9697 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I have my own business.</span>
<a name="l9698"><span class="ln">9698 </span></a><span class="s0">The De Lainey father gets it.</span>
<a name="l9699"><span class="ln">9699 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery just stares.</span>
<a name="l9700"><span class="ln">9700 </span></a><span class="s0">But he sets his jaw and doesn’t shrink away.</span>
<a name="l9701"><span class="ln">9701 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What about Sam?’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l9702"><span class="ln">9702 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That’s if Sam chooses to go back to court.</span>
<a name="l9703"><span class="ln">9703 </span></a><span class="s0">Finally he swears.</span>
<a name="l9704"><span class="ln">9704 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack gives a low whistle.</span>
<a name="l9705"><span class="ln">9705 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dinner’s in five minutes.</span>
<a name="l9706"><span class="ln">9706 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery, come inside and get some water.</span>
<a name="l9707"><span class="ln">9707 </span></a><span class="s0">Well, she did.</span>
<a name="l9708"><span class="ln">9708 </span></a><span class="s0">Just a little.</span>
<a name="l9709"><span class="ln">9709 </span></a><span class="s0">She matches his look, blade for blade.</span>
<a name="l9710"><span class="ln">9710 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s a joke,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l9711"><span class="ln">9711 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’ll like their food.</span>
<a name="l9712"><span class="ln">9712 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You shut up.</span>
<a name="l9713"><span class="ln">9713 </span></a><span class="s0">You scared me to death, you know that?</span>
<a name="l9714"><span class="ln">9714 </span></a><span class="s0">All his people are here.</span>
<a name="l9715"><span class="ln">9715 </span></a><span class="s0">Everything he loves.</span>
<a name="l9716"><span class="ln">9716 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Would you?’ he says.</span>
<a name="l9717"><span class="ln">9717 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Would you stay?</span>
<a name="l9718"><span class="ln">9718 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam is tired.</span>
<a name="l9719"><span class="ln">9719 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam can’t do this any more.</span>
<a name="l9720"><span class="ln">9720 </span></a><span class="s0">It folds over him.</span>
<a name="l9721"><span class="ln">9721 </span></a><span class="s0">Dishes and voices clash behind them.</span>
<a name="l9722"><span class="ln">9722 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he sets a phone next to Sam.</span>
<a name="l9723"><span class="ln">9723 </span></a><span class="s0">The phone might as well be another knife.</span>
<a name="l9724"><span class="ln">9724 </span></a><span class="s0">Except maybe he won’t be alone for ever.</span>
<a name="l9725"><span class="ln">9725 </span></a><span class="s0">So Sammy Lou picks up the phone.</span>
<a name="l9726"><span class="ln">9726 </span></a><span class="s0">The whole team at Orchard Books!</span>
<a name="l9727"><span class="ln">9727 </span></a><span class="s0">Thank you for your advice and flails!</span>
<a name="l9728"><span class="ln">9728 </span></a><span class="s0">You have been a mountain of encouragement.</span>
<a name="l9729"><span class="ln">9729 </span></a><span class="s0">Except you, Jemima.</span>
<a name="l9730"><span class="ln">9730 </span></a><span class="s0">At the wrist would be best.</span>
<a name="l9731"><span class="ln">9731 </span></a><span class="s0">How sick is that?</span>
<a name="l9732"><span class="ln">9732 </span></a><span class="s0">He’d be a scene out of a horror movie.</span>
<a name="l9733"><span class="ln">9733 </span></a><span class="s0">And he’d be free.</span>
<a name="l9734"><span class="ln">9734 </span></a><span class="s0">Because, without hands, he’s worthless to her.</span>
<a name="l9735"><span class="ln">9735 </span></a><span class="s0">To the Maestro.</span>
<a name="l9736"><span class="ln">9736 </span></a><span class="s0">He won’t even try something like that.</span>
<a name="l9737"><span class="ln">9737 </span></a><span class="s0">A taste of fudge and freedom isn’t worth it?</span>
<a name="l9738"><span class="ln">9738 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s just not made for rebellion or risks.</span>
<a name="l9739"><span class="ln">9739 </span></a><span class="s0">Fantasising is all he’s good for.</span>
<a name="l9740"><span class="ln">9740 </span></a><span class="s0">Sick dreams of mutilation, apparently.</span>

<a name="l10332"><span class="ln">10332 </span></a><span class="s0">I know he’s right.</span>
<a name="l10333"><span class="ln">10333 </span></a><span class="s0">No more arguing.</span>
<a name="l10334"><span class="ln">10334 </span></a><span class="s0">“We can do that,” Rufus says.</span>
<a name="l10335"><span class="ln">10335 </span></a><span class="s0">“I have nothing I’m gunning to do.</span>
<a name="l10336"><span class="ln">10336 </span></a><span class="s0">“What happened?” I say.</span>

<a name="l10338"><span class="ln">10338 </span></a><span class="s0">But maybe that warning wouldn’t have mattered.</span>
<a name="l10339"><span class="ln">10339 </span></a><span class="s0">Rufus sees the bird too.</span>
<a name="l10340"><span class="ln">10340 </span></a><span class="s0">“Say what?” “I don’t have this dead-is-dead-so-just-walk-away attitude,” I say.</span>
<a name="l10341"><span class="ln">10341 </span></a><span class="s0">I need to check myself.</span>
<a name="l10342"><span class="ln">10342 </span></a><span class="s0">Again.” I quit my hunt.</span>
<a name="l10343"><span class="ln">10343 </span></a><span class="s0">“Here’s the thing.</span>
<a name="l10344"><span class="ln">10344 </span></a><span class="s0">The way its eyes darted around for help.</span>
<a name="l10345"><span class="ln">10345 </span></a><span class="s0">The bird dared to leave home, at least.</span>
<a name="l10346"><span class="ln">10346 </span></a><span class="s0">“What happened then?” “I have no idea,” I admit.</span>
<a name="l10347"><span class="ln">10347 </span></a><span class="s0">“Let me find you something for the bird,” he says.</span>
<a name="l10348"><span class="ln">10348 </span></a><span class="s0">Rufus appears beside me on his bike, pedaling slowly.</span>
<a name="l10349"><span class="ln">10349 </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s a couple minutes after four,” Rufus informs me.</span>
<a name="l10350"><span class="ln">10350 </span></a><span class="s0">I know many people won’t agree or understand this sentiment.</span>
<a name="l10351"><span class="ln">10351 </span></a><span class="s0">But birds do all of this too.</span>

<a name="l10353"><span class="ln">10353 </span></a><span class="s0">“Sorry,” Rufus says.</span>
<a name="l10354"><span class="ln">10354 </span></a><span class="s0">Yo, Mateo is too good.</span>
<a name="l10355"><span class="ln">10355 </span></a><span class="s0">But I’m mad shocked to meet someone so .</span>

<a name="l10363"><span class="ln">10363 </span></a><span class="s0">He slips around the house, undone shoelaces slapping his ankles.</span>
<a name="l10364"><span class="ln">10364 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s sore enough as is, thanks.</span>
<a name="l10365"><span class="ln">10365 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s a year off for his age.</span>
<a name="l10366"><span class="ln">10366 </span></a><span class="s0">Things this family is good at: locking their house.</span>
<a name="l10367"><span class="ln">10367 </span></a><span class="s0">Things they suck at: stacking wood into a sturdy pile.</span>
<a name="l10368"><span class="ln">10368 </span></a><span class="s0">The lock picks go flying into the darkness.</span>
<a name="l10369"><span class="ln">10369 </span></a><span class="s0">At least there’s not far to fall.</span>
<a name="l10370"><span class="ln">10370 </span></a><span class="s0">At least the woodpile doesn’t tip over too.</span>
<a name="l10371"><span class="ln">10371 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dammit, Avery,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l10372"><span class="ln">10372 </span></a><span class="s0">I was joking.</span>
<a name="l10373"><span class="ln">10373 </span></a><span class="s0">Interruptions and complications and — Avery.</span>

<a name="l10375"><span class="ln">10375 </span></a><span class="s0">How shaky his hands suddenly are.</span>
<a name="l10376"><span class="ln">10376 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s just that rush of panic for nothing.</span>
<a name="l10377"><span class="ln">10377 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m about to be mad.’ Sam’s teeth clench.</span>

<a name="l10379"><span class="ln">10379 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not caught.</span>
<a name="l10380"><span class="ln">10380 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That would fix everything.’ Of course it would, Avery.</span>
<a name="l10381"><span class="ln">10381 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers curl into fists.</span>
<a name="l10382"><span class="ln">10382 </span></a><span class="s0">Sticky with blood.</span>
<a name="l10383"><span class="ln">10383 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s all bluff anyway, because he’d never hit Avery.</span>
<a name="l10384"><span class="ln">10384 </span></a><span class="s0">In fact, it’s the opposite.</span>
<a name="l10385"><span class="ln">10385 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery wilts, shoulders hunched to make himself a smaller target.</span>

<a name="l10389"><span class="ln">10389 </span></a><span class="s0">We.’ Sam opens his mouth to argue, but why bother?</span>
<a name="l10390"><span class="ln">10390 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s never said no to him in his life.</span>
<a name="l10391"><span class="ln">10391 </span></a><span class="s0">Plus he’s not wrong about how loud they’re being.</span>
<a name="l10392"><span class="ln">10392 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s truly lost it this evening.</span>
<a name="l10393"><span class="ln">10393 </span></a><span class="s0">Not that it’s an untrue feeling.</span>
<a name="l10394"><span class="ln">10394 </span></a><span class="s0">Not when he has blood on his knuckles.</span>
<a name="l10395"><span class="ln">10395 </span></a><span class="s0">He suddenly feels very tired.</span>
<a name="l10396"><span class="ln">10396 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s just this.</span>

<a name="l10412"><span class="ln">10412 </span></a><span class="s0">And that sameness?</span>

<a name="l10414"><span class="ln">10414 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s why Sam’s bloody and bruised tonight, isn’t it?</span>

<a name="l10416"><span class="ln">10416 </span></a><span class="s0">So, simple: he doesn’t get to know.</span>

<a name="l10466"><span class="ln">10466 </span></a><span class="s0">The guy was big, but Sam’s good at fighting.</span>
<a name="l10467"><span class="ln">10467 </span></a><span class="s0">It scares Avery, the way Sam hits.</span>
<a name="l10468"><span class="ln">10468 </span></a><span class="s0">It scares Sam too.</span>
<a name="l10469"><span class="ln">10469 </span></a><span class="s0">But what’s he supposed to do?</span>
<a name="l10470"><span class="ln">10470 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s got nothing else.</span>
<a name="l10471"><span class="ln">10471 </span></a><span class="s0">‘In a stolen car?</span>
<a name="l10472"><span class="ln">10472 </span></a><span class="s0">Are you insane?’ ‘We’d ditch it tomorrow.</span>
<a name="l10473"><span class="ln">10473 </span></a><span class="s0">I know cars.</span>
<a name="l10474"><span class="ln">10474 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Our plan sucks.’ Avery rocks on the bench.</span>
<a name="l10475"><span class="ln">10475 </span></a><span class="s0">Let’s just drive away.</span>
<a name="l10476"><span class="ln">10476 </span></a><span class="s0">Doesn’t he know Sam at all?</span>
<a name="l10477"><span class="ln">10477 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam looks down at his hands, fisted and trembling.</span>
<a name="l10478"><span class="ln">10478 </span></a><span class="s0">And you’re a wanted criminal.</span>
<a name="l10479"><span class="ln">10479 </span></a><span class="s0">We’re going to live in our own house.</span>
<a name="l10480"><span class="ln">10480 </span></a><span class="s0">We’re going to be OK.</span>
<a name="l10481"><span class="ln">10481 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No.’ But there are too many cracks in Sam’s voice.</span>
<a name="l10482"><span class="ln">10482 </span></a><span class="s0">How unrealistic his wishes are.</span>
<a name="l10483"><span class="ln">10483 </span></a><span class="s0">How naive he’s being.</span>
<a name="l10484"><span class="ln">10484 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s voice grows shrill.</span>
<a name="l10485"><span class="ln">10485 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But if we stay the police will catch you!</span>
<a name="l10486"><span class="ln">10486 </span></a><span class="s0">I can’t let them catch you.</span>
<a name="l10487"><span class="ln">10487 </span></a><span class="s0">It splinters against the tiles like a gunshot.</span>
<a name="l10488"><span class="ln">10488 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone’s going to hear.</span>
<a name="l10489"><span class="ln">10489 </span></a><span class="s0">This is Avery.</span>
<a name="l10490"><span class="ln">10490 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll steal a car and drive away by myself.</span>
<a name="l10491"><span class="ln">10491 </span></a><span class="s0">You c-can get caught if you want.</span>
<a name="l10492"><span class="ln">10492 </span></a><span class="s0">I don’t care.</span>
<a name="l10493"><span class="ln">10493 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t say that.’ Sam’s voice is barely a whisper.</span>
<a name="l10494"><span class="ln">10494 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll leave you.’ Don’t ever, ever say that.</span>
<a name="l10495"><span class="ln">10495 </span></a><span class="s0">He slams the door on his way out.</span>
<a name="l10496"><span class="ln">10496 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam doesn’t understand.</span>
<a name="l10497"><span class="ln">10497 </span></a><span class="s0">But he can’t stay here now.</span>
<a name="l10498"><span class="ln">10498 </span></a><span class="s0">He should run after Avery.</span>
<a name="l10499"><span class="ln">10499 </span></a><span class="s0">He didn’t mean it, right?</span>
<a name="l10500"><span class="ln">10500 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re all each other has.</span>
<a name="l10501"><span class="ln">10501 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s the only who sees Sammy Lou, the forgotten boy.</span>
<a name="l10502"><span class="ln">10502 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll leave you.</span>
<a name="l10503"><span class="ln">10503 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam doesn’t take anything on his way out.</span>
<a name="l10504"><span class="ln">10504 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s his secret failure.</span>
<a name="l10505"><span class="ln">10505 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t break into houses because he enjoys stealing.</span>
<a name="l10506"><span class="ln">10506 </span></a><span class="s0">No, let’s have a winter rerun.</span>
<a name="l10507"><span class="ln">10507 </span></a><span class="s0">Won’t that be fun?</span>
<a name="l10508"><span class="ln">10508 </span></a><span class="s0">It keeps most of the rain off.</span>
<a name="l10509"><span class="ln">10509 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery will go back to his shifty friends’ house.</span>
<a name="l10510"><span class="ln">10510 </span></a><span class="s0">No, no he will.</span>
<a name="l10511"><span class="ln">10511 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a stupid threat.</span>
<a name="l10512"><span class="ln">10512 </span></a><span class="s0">He could never just go.</span>
<a name="l10513"><span class="ln">10513 </span></a><span class="s0">It’ll be a nice day – Saturday, right?</span>
<a name="l10514"><span class="ln">10514 </span></a><span class="s0">At least that’s what he pretends normal people do.</span>
<a name="l10515"><span class="ln">10515 </span></a><span class="s0">His thoughts spin, dizzying.</span>
<a name="l10516"><span class="ln">10516 </span></a><span class="s0">He feels genuinely ill right now.</span>
<a name="l10517"><span class="ln">10517 </span></a><span class="s0">His nose won’t stop running.</span>
<a name="l10518"><span class="ln">10518 </span></a><span class="s0">She might be in a good mood.</span>
<a name="l10519"><span class="ln">10519 </span></a><span class="s0">Or she’ll call the police.</span>
<a name="l10520"><span class="ln">10520 </span></a><span class="s0">Who is he kidding?</span>
<a name="l10521"><span class="ln">10521 </span></a><span class="s0">This is Aunt Karen.</span>
<a name="l10522"><span class="ln">10522 </span></a><span class="s0">If she sees him, she’ll go straight to the phone.</span>
<a name="l10523"><span class="ln">10523 </span></a><span class="s0">Stealing houses is an art.</span>
<a name="l10524"><span class="ln">10524 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs to get off the streets and lie down.</span>
<a name="l10525"><span class="ln">10525 </span></a><span class="s0">He tries two houses.</span>
<a name="l10526"><span class="ln">10526 </span></a><span class="s0">The second house is definitely a victim of longer-term abandonment.</span>
<a name="l10527"><span class="ln">10527 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t risk staying here.</span>
<a name="l10528"><span class="ln">10528 </span></a><span class="s0">He could find a payphone and call Avery.</span>
<a name="l10529"><span class="ln">10529 </span></a><span class="s0">At least his clothes dry in the warm midday sun.</span>
<a name="l10530"><span class="ln">10530 </span></a><span class="s0">Wow, he’s so healthy.</span>
<a name="l10531"><span class="ln">10531 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam checks the street.</span>
<a name="l10532"><span class="ln">10532 </span></a><span class="s0">He listens at the doors but it’s silent.</span>
<a name="l10533"><span class="ln">10533 </span></a><span class="s0">Please be empty, please please please.</span>
<a name="l10534"><span class="ln">10534 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s an open-plan room, with support poles instead of walls.</span>
<a name="l10535"><span class="ln">10535 </span></a><span class="s0">Check for fresh food?</span>
<a name="l10536"><span class="ln">10536 </span></a><span class="s0">Still … that’s promising.</span>
<a name="l10537"><span class="ln">10537 </span></a><span class="s0">Another sign that the occupants are away.</span>
<a name="l10538"><span class="ln">10538 </span></a><span class="s0">Back on Sunday.</span>
<a name="l10539"><span class="ln">10539 </span></a><span class="s0">The house is his.</span>
<a name="l10540"><span class="ln">10540 </span></a><span class="s0">Take that, you freaking streaming nose.</span>
<a name="l10541"><span class="ln">10541 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s favourite type of house.</span>
<a name="l10542"><span class="ln">10542 </span></a><span class="s0">By the way, Sam, you are a freak.</span>
<a name="l10543"><span class="ln">10543 </span></a><span class="s0">He feels feverishly warm.</span>
<a name="l10544"><span class="ln">10544 </span></a><span class="s0">OK, so these people don’t believe in cupboards.</span>
<a name="l10545"><span class="ln">10545 </span></a><span class="s0">They believe in obstacle courses.</span>
<a name="l10546"><span class="ln">10546 </span></a><span class="s0">He has a new appreciation for only having one brother.</span>
<a name="l10547"><span class="ln">10547 </span></a><span class="s0">Imagine a dozen Averys?</span>
<a name="l10548"><span class="ln">10548 </span></a><span class="s0">No thank you.</span>
<a name="l10549"><span class="ln">10549 </span></a><span class="s0">He is so very, very tired.</span>
<a name="l10550"><span class="ln">10550 </span></a><span class="s0">Side effects probably … definitely … include … drowsiness.</span>
<a name="l10551"><span class="ln">10551 </span></a><span class="s0">The sun is so warm on his cheek.</span>
<a name="l10552"><span class="ln">10552 </span></a><span class="s0">But if Sammy complains he’ll just get another slap.</span>
<a name="l10553"><span class="ln">10553 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery hums softly to himself in the seat beside Sammy.</span>
<a name="l10554"><span class="ln">10554 </span></a><span class="s0">He knows Avery’s just sharing, but Sammy’s hungry.</span>
<a name="l10555"><span class="ln">10555 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he goes still.</span>
<a name="l10556"><span class="ln">10556 </span></a><span class="s0">Scared of a slap.</span>
<a name="l10557"><span class="ln">10557 </span></a><span class="s0">Scared, even more, that Avery will get it.</span>
<a name="l10558"><span class="ln">10558 </span></a><span class="s0">He should’ve stayed quiet.</span>
<a name="l10559"><span class="ln">10559 </span></a><span class="s0">People stream out and in, wearing silly dresses.</span>
<a name="l10560"><span class="ln">10560 </span></a><span class="s0">They must be cold.</span>
<a name="l10561"><span class="ln">10561 </span></a><span class="s0">He reaches back and snatches the toy off Avery.</span>
<a name="l10562"><span class="ln">10562 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery gives a surprised yelp.</span>
<a name="l10563"><span class="ln">10563 </span></a><span class="s0">A sick hole gnaws at Sam’s stomach.</span>
<a name="l10564"><span class="ln">10564 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Grow up, Avery,’ their dad snaps.</span>
<a name="l10565"><span class="ln">10565 </span></a><span class="s0">His voice is a warning growl.</span>
<a name="l10566"><span class="ln">10566 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll be a few minutes.</span>
<a name="l10567"><span class="ln">10567 </span></a><span class="s0">Sit here while I pick something up.</span>
<a name="l10568"><span class="ln">10568 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy glances sideways at Avery.</span>
<a name="l10569"><span class="ln">10569 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs his car.</span>
<a name="l10570"><span class="ln">10570 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s his special car.</span>
<a name="l10571"><span class="ln">10571 </span></a><span class="s0">He always has it.</span>
<a name="l10572"><span class="ln">10572 </span></a><span class="s0">Fix this, Sammy.</span>
<a name="l10573"><span class="ln">10573 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He’ll give it back,’ says Sammy.</span>
<a name="l10574"><span class="ln">10574 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Just be good.</span>
<a name="l10575"><span class="ln">10575 </span></a><span class="s0">Just wait.’ Please please please.</span>
<a name="l10576"><span class="ln">10576 </span></a><span class="s0">His dad has been angry ever since.</span>
<a name="l10577"><span class="ln">10577 </span></a><span class="s0">Well, he’s always angry.</span>
<a name="l10578"><span class="ln">10578 </span></a><span class="s0">This is not good.</span>
<a name="l10579"><span class="ln">10579 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t move.</span>
<a name="l10580"><span class="ln">10580 </span></a><span class="s0">He hates loud things.</span>
<a name="l10581"><span class="ln">10581 </span></a><span class="s0">Why’s he going in there?</span>
<a name="l10582"><span class="ln">10582 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t need his car that much, does he?</span>
<a name="l10583"><span class="ln">10583 </span></a><span class="s0">He sits there, handfuls of wild butterflies in his belly.</span>
<a name="l10584"><span class="ln">10584 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery never figures anything out.</span>
<a name="l10585"><span class="ln">10585 </span></a><span class="s0">But maybe it’ll be OK?</span>
<a name="l10586"><span class="ln">10586 </span></a><span class="s0">Are they all laughing?</span>
<a name="l10587"><span class="ln">10587 </span></a><span class="s0">You have to hold him.</span>
<a name="l10588"><span class="ln">10588 </span></a><span class="s0">You have to take him away till he calms down.</span>
<a name="l10589"><span class="ln">10589 </span></a><span class="s0">Even Sammy knows this and he’s only seven.</span>
<a name="l10590"><span class="ln">10590 </span></a><span class="s0">Hard to do because Avery writhes and kicks.</span>
<a name="l10591"><span class="ln">10591 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy holds his breath.</span>
<a name="l10592"><span class="ln">10592 </span></a><span class="s0">It’ll fix everything.</span>
<a name="l10593"><span class="ln">10593 </span></a><span class="s0">It doesn’t matter if Avery’s too old.</span>
<a name="l10594"><span class="ln">10594 </span></a><span class="s0">It makes him feel better.</span>
<a name="l10595"><span class="ln">10595 </span></a><span class="s0">And he hits him.</span>
<a name="l10596"><span class="ln">10596 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s screams turn to sobs.</span>
<a name="l10597"><span class="ln">10597 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy fights with his seatbelt now.</span>
<a name="l10598"><span class="ln">10598 </span></a><span class="s0">No one to hear over the thunder of the club.</span>
<a name="l10599"><span class="ln">10599 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s beaten his knuckles bloody on the window.</span>
<a name="l10600"><span class="ln">10600 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy can’t breathe.</span>
<a name="l10601"><span class="ln">10601 </span></a><span class="s0">He is red fire and he is burning.</span>
<a name="l10602"><span class="ln">10602 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re not allowed to hit Avery like that.</span>
<a name="l10603"><span class="ln">10603 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re not allowed.</span>
<a name="l10604"><span class="ln">10604 </span></a><span class="s0">He stretches shivering fingers to his brother.</span>
<a name="l10605"><span class="ln">10605 </span></a><span class="s0">His brother who is finally still and quiet.</span>
<a name="l10606"><span class="ln">10606 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s being good.</span>
<a name="l10607"><span class="ln">10607 </span></a><span class="s0">He wriggles free and crawls across the seat to Avery.</span>
<a name="l10608"><span class="ln">10608 </span></a><span class="s0">But his eyes find the rearview mirror and meet Sammy’s.</span>
<a name="l10609"><span class="ln">10609 </span></a><span class="s0">His dad’s eyes are furious.</span>
<a name="l10610"><span class="ln">10610 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy hates him.</span>
<a name="l10611"><span class="ln">10611 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy, strong and fierce, crouches over his brother.</span>
<a name="l10612"><span class="ln">10612 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s OK,’ Sammy whispers.</span>
<a name="l10613"><span class="ln">10613 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s voice is trembly but fierce.</span>
<a name="l10614"><span class="ln">10614 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll kill them.’ Deep in the house, Avery is shouting.</span>
<a name="l10615"><span class="ln">10615 </span></a><span class="s0">But he hasn’t slept this well in a long time.</span>
<a name="l10616"><span class="ln">10616 </span></a><span class="s0">Probably because he drugged himself.</span>
<a name="l10617"><span class="ln">10617 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam frowns in his sleep.</span>
<a name="l10618"><span class="ln">10618 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s in an empty house.</span>
<a name="l10619"><span class="ln">10619 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s not … empty.</span>
<a name="l10620"><span class="ln">10620 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s in a house that’s not empty.</span>
<a name="l10621"><span class="ln">10621 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not even sure what time it is.</span>
<a name="l10622"><span class="ln">10622 </span></a><span class="s0">Did he sleep all night?</span>
<a name="l10623"><span class="ln">10623 </span></a><span class="s0">He scrabbles off the armchair and over to the desk.</span>
<a name="l10624"><span class="ln">10624 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s slept for a whole day.</span>
<a name="l10625"><span class="ln">10625 </span></a><span class="s0">This can’t be happening.</span>
<a name="l10626"><span class="ln">10626 </span></a><span class="s0">Not hearing Avery sneak up on him is one thing.</span>
<a name="l10627"><span class="ln">10627 </span></a><span class="s0">But sleeping through a family returning?</span>
<a name="l10628"><span class="ln">10628 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s losing his touch.</span>
<a name="l10629"><span class="ln">10629 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s losing his mind.</span>
<a name="l10630"><span class="ln">10630 </span></a><span class="s0">They haven’t come in here yet, so that’s good.</span>
<a name="l10631"><span class="ln">10631 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing is good.</span>
<a name="l10632"><span class="ln">10632 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s in a house full of people.</span>
<a name="l10633"><span class="ln">10633 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t get out.</span>
<a name="l10634"><span class="ln">10634 </span></a><span class="s0">‘DAD!’ a girl’s voice hollers right outside the office door.</span>
<a name="l10635"><span class="ln">10635 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Which one?’ someone else yells, softer and distant.</span>
<a name="l10636"><span class="ln">10636 </span></a><span class="s0">Hands scrabbling for a phone.</span>
<a name="l10637"><span class="ln">10637 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to hide.</span>
<a name="l10638"><span class="ln">10638 </span></a><span class="s0">Then the door opens and he forgets how to breathe.</span>
<a name="l10639"><span class="ln">10639 </span></a><span class="s0">A girl storms in.</span>
<a name="l10640"><span class="ln">10640 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s knees are at his throat.</span>
<a name="l10641"><span class="ln">10641 </span></a><span class="s0">His heart punches new bruises into his ribs.</span>
<a name="l10642"><span class="ln">10642 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re such an idiot, Sammy Lou.</span>
<a name="l10643"><span class="ln">10643 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam stuffs knuckles into his mouth and bites.</span>
<a name="l10644"><span class="ln">10644 </span></a><span class="s0">Just hold on, just wait.</span>

<a name="l10646"><span class="ln">10646 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s the only thing he owns.</span>
<a name="l10647"><span class="ln">10647 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ugh, Jack,’ she mutters, and steps over it.</span>
<a name="l10648"><span class="ln">10648 </span></a><span class="s0">She steps over it!</span>
<a name="l10649"><span class="ln">10649 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam remembers oxygen.</span>
<a name="l10650"><span class="ln">10650 </span></a><span class="s0">And in this mess, that’s probably likely.</span>
<a name="l10651"><span class="ln">10651 </span></a><span class="s0">Whoever ‘Jack’ is, he can happily take the blame.</span>
<a name="l10652"><span class="ln">10652 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam is fine with that.</span>
<a name="l10653"><span class="ln">10653 </span></a><span class="s0">Please don’t come back.</span>
<a name="l10654"><span class="ln">10654 </span></a><span class="s0">After a few deep gulps, he crawls out.</span>
<a name="l10655"><span class="ln">10655 </span></a><span class="s0">He grabs his backpack and opens the door a crack.</span>
<a name="l10656"><span class="ln">10656 </span></a><span class="s0">The hall is empty.</span>
<a name="l10657"><span class="ln">10657 </span></a><span class="s0">Unfortunately downstairs has no walls to hide behind.</span>

<a name="l10659"><span class="ln">10659 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t put it off.</span>
<a name="l10660"><span class="ln">10660 </span></a><span class="s0">He slips out of the warm office, his false safety.</span>
<a name="l10661"><span class="ln">10661 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s doing this.</span>
<a name="l10662"><span class="ln">10662 </span></a><span class="s0">The damage is immense.</span>
<a name="l10663"><span class="ln">10663 </span></a><span class="s0">There truly are half a million people down there.</span>

<a name="l10665"><span class="ln">10665 </span></a><span class="s0">A plate breaks.</span>

<a name="l10669"><span class="ln">10669 </span></a><span class="s0">Get the baby.</span>

<a name="l10673"><span class="ln">10673 </span></a><span class="s0">They are all hopelessly consumed with each other.</span>
<a name="l10674"><span class="ln">10674 </span></a><span class="s0">Drunk on people and noise and food.</span>
<a name="l10675"><span class="ln">10675 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam can do this.</span>
<a name="l10676"><span class="ln">10676 </span></a><span class="s0">Isn’t that his entire life?</span>
<a name="l10677"><span class="ln">10677 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam moves for the stairs, hand on the rail.</span>
<a name="l10678"><span class="ln">10678 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood pulses in his ears.</span>

<a name="l10680"><span class="ln">10680 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyebrows are angry forests.</span>
<a name="l10681"><span class="ln">10681 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dude, I don’t even recognise you,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l10682"><span class="ln">10682 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t you know how Sundays work?</span>
<a name="l10683"><span class="ln">10683 </span></a><span class="s0">The exit is officially an ocean away.</span>
<a name="l10684"><span class="ln">10684 </span></a><span class="s0">They could all see him if only they looked up.</span>
<a name="l10685"><span class="ln">10685 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re shooed along by another boy.</span>
<a name="l10686"><span class="ln">10686 </span></a><span class="s0">But the boy beats him to it.</span>
<a name="l10687"><span class="ln">10687 </span></a><span class="s0">But – oh wait.</span>
<a name="l10688"><span class="ln">10688 </span></a><span class="s0">He stole a shirt.</span>
<a name="l10689"><span class="ln">10689 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s probably unique.</span>
<a name="l10690"><span class="ln">10690 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s probably special.</span>
<a name="l10691"><span class="ln">10691 </span></a><span class="s0">He didn’t mean to be here.</span>
<a name="l10692"><span class="ln">10692 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Jeremy’s friend?’ The boy sighs.</span>
<a name="l10693"><span class="ln">10693 </span></a><span class="s0">Did he even tell you how Sundays work?</span>
<a name="l10694"><span class="ln">10694 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You look shell-shocked.</span>
<a name="l10695"><span class="ln">10695 </span></a><span class="s0">Hit him and run.</span>
<a name="l10696"><span class="ln">10696 </span></a><span class="s0">He nearly does.</span>
<a name="l10697"><span class="ln">10697 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he’s gone.</span>
<a name="l10698"><span class="ln">10698 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam might be having a panic attack.</span>
<a name="l10699"><span class="ln">10699 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh, you must be one of Jeremy’s friends, right?</span>
<a name="l10700"><span class="ln">10700 </span></a><span class="s0">And he’s nodding.</span>
<a name="l10701"><span class="ln">10701 </span></a><span class="s0">What is he supposed to do?</span>
<a name="l10702"><span class="ln">10702 </span></a><span class="s0">Just a little.</span>
<a name="l10703"><span class="ln">10703 </span></a><span class="s0">Well, what the hell, right?</span>
<a name="l10704"><span class="ln">10704 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s officially taken house burglary to the next level.</span>
<a name="l10705"><span class="ln">10705 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s stealing families and their Sunday lunches.</span>
<a name="l10706"><span class="ln">10706 </span></a><span class="s0">Faces blur together.</span>
<a name="l10707"><span class="ln">10707 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s totally fine with that.</span>
<a name="l10708"><span class="ln">10708 </span></a><span class="s0">But he won’t press his luck.</span>
<a name="l10709"><span class="ln">10709 </span></a><span class="s0">His pulse stutters.</span>
<a name="l10710"><span class="ln">10710 </span></a><span class="s0">Well, he knew he’d get caught, didn’t he?</span>
<a name="l10711"><span class="ln">10711 </span></a><span class="s0">He deserves the shriek of intruder.</span>
<a name="l10712"><span class="ln">10712 </span></a><span class="s0">Except it doesn’t come.</span>
<a name="l10713"><span class="ln">10713 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I was just leaving—’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l10714"><span class="ln">10714 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Kitchen.’ She claps her hands together briskly.</span>
<a name="l10715"><span class="ln">10715 </span></a><span class="s0">Dishwasher is already full.</span>
<a name="l10716"><span class="ln">10716 </span></a><span class="s0">After all, he did eat their food.</span>
<a name="l10717"><span class="ln">10717 </span></a><span class="s0">This entire day is doing his head in.</span>
<a name="l10718"><span class="ln">10718 </span></a><span class="s0">Plates keep coming.</span>
<a name="l10719"><span class="ln">10719 </span></a><span class="s0">He wipes his sodden hands on his shirt.</span>
<a name="l10720"><span class="ln">10720 </span></a><span class="s0">He takes one.</span>
<a name="l10721"><span class="ln">10721 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Take two,’ says the man.</span>
<a name="l10722"><span class="ln">10722 </span></a><span class="s0">Did they leave you with the dishes?</span>
<a name="l10723"><span class="ln">10723 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re now playing cricket on the street.</span>
<a name="l10724"><span class="ln">10724 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll leave the plate here.</span>
<a name="l10725"><span class="ln">10725 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so pathetic, right?</span>
<a name="l10726"><span class="ln">10726 </span></a><span class="s0">That he’d lap this up.</span>
<a name="l10727"><span class="ln">10727 </span></a><span class="s0">The girl still looks at Sam.</span>
<a name="l10728"><span class="ln">10728 </span></a><span class="s0">‘So,’ says the girl.</span>
<a name="l10729"><span class="ln">10729 </span></a><span class="s0">She’s going to talk to him?</span>
<a name="l10730"><span class="ln">10730 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re kind of small compared to Jeremy’s usual strays.</span>
<a name="l10731"><span class="ln">10731 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I don’t trust you.’ Sam’s throat is dry.</span>
<a name="l10732"><span class="ln">10732 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well, I don’t trust whoever killed this pot.</span>
<a name="l10733"><span class="ln">10733 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That was me.’ Oh.</span>
<a name="l10734"><span class="ln">10734 </span></a><span class="s0">He notices there’s handsewn embroidery all over the skirt.</span>
<a name="l10735"><span class="ln">10735 </span></a><span class="s0">So she’s the seamstress.</span>
<a name="l10736"><span class="ln">10736 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well,’ Moxie says, ‘it sucked.</span>
<a name="l10737"><span class="ln">10737 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How was your trip?’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l10738"><span class="ln">10738 </span></a><span class="s0">‘The camping trip you boys all went on?</span>
<a name="l10739"><span class="ln">10739 </span></a><span class="s0">You all need to shower, by the way.</span>
<a name="l10740"><span class="ln">10740 </span></a><span class="s0">For hours.’ Sam can play along, right?</span>
<a name="l10741"><span class="ln">10741 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s got this.</span>
<a name="l10742"><span class="ln">10742 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh, well … it was great.</span>
<a name="l10743"><span class="ln">10743 </span></a><span class="s0">Good, um, weather.’ What do you even say about camping?</span>
<a name="l10744"><span class="ln">10744 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s never been camping.</span>
<a name="l10745"><span class="ln">10745 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Chatty, aren’t you?’ Moxie licks brownie off her thumb.</span>
<a name="l10746"><span class="ln">10746 </span></a><span class="s0">Why is he still talking?</span>
<a name="l10747"><span class="ln">10747 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Excuse you,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l10748"><span class="ln">10748 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Speaking of being disagreeable,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l10749"><span class="ln">10749 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Why hasn’t Jeremy come to rescue you anyway?</span>
<a name="l10750"><span class="ln">10750 </span></a><span class="s0">Technically now I’m yours.</span>
<a name="l10751"><span class="ln">10751 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey, we’re going to the beach,’ a boy tells Moxie.</span>
<a name="l10752"><span class="ln">10752 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hi,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l10753"><span class="ln">10753 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Are you Moxie’s friend?</span>
<a name="l10754"><span class="ln">10754 </span></a><span class="s0">She doesn’t usually invite people over.’ He smiles.</span>
<a name="l10755"><span class="ln">10755 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m Jeremy.’ No, I’m supposed to be your friend.</span>
<a name="l10756"><span class="ln">10756 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ah, yeah, Moxie’s friend,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l10757"><span class="ln">10757 </span></a><span class="s0">Get out of there, man.</span>
<a name="l10758"><span class="ln">10758 </span></a><span class="s0">We’re going to the beach.</span>
<a name="l10759"><span class="ln">10759 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not going to the beach with them.</span>
<a name="l10760"><span class="ln">10760 </span></a><span class="s0">Because why not.</span>
<a name="l10761"><span class="ln">10761 </span></a><span class="s0">Just don’t ask me who I am.</span>
<a name="l10762"><span class="ln">10762 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy reappears, eating leftover potato salad with a soup ladle.</span>
<a name="l10763"><span class="ln">10763 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ready?’ he says to no one in particular.</span>
<a name="l10764"><span class="ln">10764 </span></a><span class="s0">Is Moxie back yet?</span>
<a name="l10765"><span class="ln">10765 </span></a><span class="s0">What’s she doing up there?’ He raises his voice.</span>
<a name="l10766"><span class="ln">10766 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How long does it take to put swimmers on, Moxie!</span>
<a name="l10767"><span class="ln">10767 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Girls,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l10768"><span class="ln">10768 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack yelps and grabs his side like he’s been shot.</span>
<a name="l10769"><span class="ln">10769 </span></a><span class="s0">The hordes pour towards the door.</span>
<a name="l10770"><span class="ln">10770 </span></a><span class="s0">And Moxie is nearly a head shorter than everyone else.</span>
<a name="l10771"><span class="ln">10771 </span></a><span class="s0">He wonders if she’s his age.</span>
<a name="l10772"><span class="ln">10772 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants this.</span>
<a name="l10773"><span class="ln">10773 </span></a><span class="s0">He absolutely can’t have it.</span>
<a name="l10774"><span class="ln">10774 </span></a><span class="s0">She catches his eye and he looks away.</span>
<a name="l10775"><span class="ln">10775 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Coming, dishwasher boy?’ It’s because they don’t know him.</span>
<a name="l10776"><span class="ln">10776 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s absolutely mad, of course, to follow them.</span>
<a name="l10777"><span class="ln">10777 </span></a><span class="s0">How could you?</span>
<a name="l10778"><span class="ln">10778 </span></a><span class="s0">They don’t know him.</span>
<a name="l10779"><span class="ln">10779 </span></a><span class="s0">Why the police want him.</span>
<a name="l10780"><span class="ln">10780 </span></a><span class="s0">Why his aunt won’t even look at him.</span>
<a name="l10781"><span class="ln">10781 </span></a><span class="s0">And it feels good.</span>
<a name="l10782"><span class="ln">10782 </span></a><span class="s0">She glances sideways at Sam.</span>
<a name="l10783"><span class="ln">10783 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Are you swimming in jeans?</span>
<a name="l10784"><span class="ln">10784 </span></a><span class="s0">She bats it off and glares.</span>
<a name="l10785"><span class="ln">10785 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Eh, just swim in your boxers,’ Jeremy says lightly.</span>
<a name="l10786"><span class="ln">10786 </span></a><span class="s0">He jerks the hem down quickly.</span>
<a name="l10787"><span class="ln">10787 </span></a><span class="s0">She purses her lips together, like she’ll ask.</span>
<a name="l10788"><span class="ln">10788 </span></a><span class="s0">Please don’t ask.</span>
<a name="l10789"><span class="ln">10789 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s deep enough.</span>
<a name="l10790"><span class="ln">10790 </span></a><span class="s0">We threw Jack in headfirst to test it once.</span>
<a name="l10791"><span class="ln">10791 </span></a><span class="s0">No broken neck.’ ‘Pity,’ mutters Moxie.</span>
<a name="l10792"><span class="ln">10792 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And definitely don’t do anything Jack wouldn’t do.</span>
<a name="l10793"><span class="ln">10793 </span></a><span class="s0">Actually, don’t do anything Jack would do.</span>
<a name="l10794"><span class="ln">10794 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam finds himself looking anywhere but at her indigo bikini.</span>
<a name="l10795"><span class="ln">10795 </span></a><span class="s0">And then realises how conspicuous that is.</span>
<a name="l10796"><span class="ln">10796 </span></a><span class="s0">And then realises he’s blushing.</span>
<a name="l10797"><span class="ln">10797 </span></a><span class="s0">And then decides he needs to go drown.</span>
<a name="l10798"><span class="ln">10798 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie never so much walks as marches with angry intensity.</span>
<a name="l10799"><span class="ln">10799 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy pats Sam on the shoulder.</span>
<a name="l10800"><span class="ln">10800 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You look nervous.</span>
<a name="l10801"><span class="ln">10801 </span></a><span class="s0">The water seems deep.</span>
<a name="l10802"><span class="ln">10802 </span></a><span class="s0">The rocks are hot.</span>
<a name="l10803"><span class="ln">10803 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack ignores her, eyes lighting on Sam.</span>
<a name="l10804"><span class="ln">10804 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s heart still crawls into his mouth.</span>
<a name="l10805"><span class="ln">10805 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks away.</span>
<a name="l10806"><span class="ln">10806 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t imagine Avery enjoying this day.</span>
<a name="l10807"><span class="ln">10807 </span></a><span class="s0">He tries, but he just can’t.</span>
<a name="l10808"><span class="ln">10808 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey!’ someone says, a note of panic in their voice.</span>
<a name="l10809"><span class="ln">10809 </span></a><span class="s0">Does it matter?</span>
<a name="l10810"><span class="ln">10810 </span></a><span class="s0">And the sea hits him.</span>
<a name="l10811"><span class="ln">10811 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s shockingly cool.</span>
<a name="l10812"><span class="ln">10812 </span></a><span class="s0">Then his head splits the surface.</span>
<a name="l10813"><span class="ln">10813 </span></a><span class="s0">Where was the part where he stayed low profile?</span>
<a name="l10814"><span class="ln">10814 </span></a><span class="s0">Something like anger.</span>
<a name="l10815"><span class="ln">10815 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy treads water and then splashes water into Sam’s face.</span>
<a name="l10816"><span class="ln">10816 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Maniac.’ But he’s smiling.</span>
<a name="l10817"><span class="ln">10817 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s not hard.’ ‘Oi!</span>
<a name="l10818"><span class="ln">10818 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sam?’ But he says it like a question.</span>
<a name="l10819"><span class="ln">10819 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well, get up here.</span>
<a name="l10820"><span class="ln">10820 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy dodges and gets a mouthful of ocean.</span>
<a name="l10821"><span class="ln">10821 </span></a><span class="s0">He goes under garbling.</span>
<a name="l10822"><span class="ln">10822 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Get up here, kid.</span>
<a name="l10823"><span class="ln">10823 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m keeping you.</span>
<a name="l10824"><span class="ln">10824 </span></a><span class="s0">Underwater, no one but the ocean sees him smile.</span>
<a name="l10825"><span class="ln">10825 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy is seven and maybe Avery is dead.</span>

<a name="l10827"><span class="ln">10827 </span></a><span class="s0">Please please please.</span>
<a name="l10828"><span class="ln">10828 </span></a><span class="s0">The car pulls into a driveway, the engine rattles off.</span>
<a name="l10829"><span class="ln">10829 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy, now with Avery’s head in his lap, goes stiff.</span>
<a name="l10830"><span class="ln">10830 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he hammers the front door.</span>
<a name="l10831"><span class="ln">10831 </span></a><span class="s0">Karen, open up.’ A dog across the street barks.</span>
<a name="l10832"><span class="ln">10832 </span></a><span class="s0">A slow car rumbles past.</span>
<a name="l10833"><span class="ln">10833 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery shifts in his arms.</span>
<a name="l10834"><span class="ln">10834 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s something wrong with Avery’s eyes.</span>
<a name="l10835"><span class="ln">10835 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re dull and broken and hollow.</span>
<a name="l10836"><span class="ln">10836 </span></a><span class="s0">He drags Avery out.</span>
<a name="l10837"><span class="ln">10837 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery doesn’t even whimper.</span>
<a name="l10838"><span class="ln">10838 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Be on your best behaviour.’ His voice is raw.</span>
<a name="l10839"><span class="ln">10839 </span></a><span class="s0">Her lips are a line.</span>
<a name="l10840"><span class="ln">10840 </span></a><span class="s0">Her brow furrows.</span>
<a name="l10841"><span class="ln">10841 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What’s going on, Clay?’ she snaps.</span>
<a name="l10842"><span class="ln">10842 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I just told you, Jen isn’t here.</span>
<a name="l10843"><span class="ln">10843 </span></a><span class="s0">His aunt stares.</span>
<a name="l10844"><span class="ln">10844 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I haven’t seen you kids in four years.</span>
<a name="l10845"><span class="ln">10845 </span></a><span class="s0">No, six.’ ‘I’m Sammy,’ he whispers.</span>
<a name="l10846"><span class="ln">10846 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t remember her.</span>
<a name="l10847"><span class="ln">10847 </span></a><span class="s0">Like, in his head, their dad hasn’t stopped hitting him.</span>
<a name="l10848"><span class="ln">10848 </span></a><span class="s0">Then his dad yells.</span>
<a name="l10849"><span class="ln">10849 </span></a><span class="s0">Then Aunt Karen yells.</span>
<a name="l10850"><span class="ln">10850 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy wants to cover Avery’s ears.</span>
<a name="l10851"><span class="ln">10851 </span></a><span class="s0">His whole trembling body.</span>
<a name="l10852"><span class="ln">10852 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone has to protect him.</span>
<a name="l10853"><span class="ln">10853 </span></a><span class="s0">But he can do this.</span>
<a name="l10854"><span class="ln">10854 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he turns on his boys, eyes molten pools.</span>
<a name="l10855"><span class="ln">10855 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s chest tightens.</span>
<a name="l10856"><span class="ln">10856 </span></a><span class="s0">But his dad just holds out the toy car.</span>
<a name="l10857"><span class="ln">10857 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s chest tightens, a fist on his lungs.</span>
<a name="l10858"><span class="ln">10858 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he snatches the car.</span>
<a name="l10859"><span class="ln">10859 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Because that’s where it ends, Sammy boy.</span>
<a name="l10860"><span class="ln">10860 </span></a><span class="s0">He wouldn’t give them to his dad anyway.</span>
<a name="l10861"><span class="ln">10861 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen comes back inside, rewrapping her tulip dressing gown.</span>
<a name="l10862"><span class="ln">10862 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Is he coming back soon?’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l10863"><span class="ln">10863 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen closes her eyes.</span>
<a name="l10864"><span class="ln">10864 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re staying with me for a while.</span>
<a name="l10865"><span class="ln">10865 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen sighs and reaches for Avery.</span>
<a name="l10866"><span class="ln">10866 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Avery,’ she snaps.</span>
<a name="l10867"><span class="ln">10867 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Let me help.</span>
<a name="l10868"><span class="ln">10868 </span></a><span class="s0">To stand on top of the wicker chair and scream.</span>
<a name="l10869"><span class="ln">10869 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyes are burned out blue.</span>
<a name="l10870"><span class="ln">10870 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t take his—’ Sammy says, but it’s too late.</span>
<a name="l10871"><span class="ln">10871 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery starts screaming.</span>
<a name="l10872"><span class="ln">10872 </span></a><span class="s0">And he just doesn’t stop.</span>
<a name="l10873"><span class="ln">10873 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam hesitates on the stairs.</span>
<a name="l10874"><span class="ln">10874 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You might as well stay for dinner,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l10875"><span class="ln">10875 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sunday night is waffles.’ Sam stays.</span>
<a name="l10876"><span class="ln">10876 </span></a><span class="s0">The house has emptied considerably.</span>
<a name="l10877"><span class="ln">10877 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie’s dad waves from the kitchen.</span>
<a name="l10878"><span class="ln">10878 </span></a><span class="s0">Hopefully that’s a joke.</span>
<a name="l10879"><span class="ln">10879 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How many are staying, Jeremy?’ he says.</span>
<a name="l10880"><span class="ln">10880 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’re teenage boys.’ Jeremy smacks him playfully on the head.</span>
<a name="l10881"><span class="ln">10881 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Only six of us guys left.</span>
<a name="l10882"><span class="ln">10882 </span></a><span class="s0">Thanks for remembering me.</span>
<a name="l10883"><span class="ln">10883 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t forget Jack’s new adopted hatchling Sam.’ Sam shrinks.</span>
<a name="l10884"><span class="ln">10884 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t help it.</span>
<a name="l10885"><span class="ln">10885 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Did you swim in your clothes?</span>
<a name="l10886"><span class="ln">10886 </span></a><span class="s0">Their father wisely makes more waffles.</span>
<a name="l10887"><span class="ln">10887 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dude, don’t you ever eat?</span>
<a name="l10888"><span class="ln">10888 </span></a><span class="s0">Please consume at least nineteen waffles tonight.</span>
<a name="l10889"><span class="ln">10889 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He could wear a towel?’ Sam feels a little panicky.</span>
<a name="l10890"><span class="ln">10890 </span></a><span class="s0">Then she notices.</span>
<a name="l10891"><span class="ln">10891 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What?’ She looks at them and then at Sam.</span>
<a name="l10892"><span class="ln">10892 </span></a><span class="s0">No.’ ‘Come on, he’s your height,’ Jeremy says.</span>
<a name="l10893"><span class="ln">10893 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll clean his clothes super fast.</span>
<a name="l10894"><span class="ln">10894 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks up to three concerned faces.</span>
<a name="l10895"><span class="ln">10895 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Look, he’s gone and caught cold,’ Jeremy says reproachfully.</span>
<a name="l10896"><span class="ln">10896 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I had the flu already,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l10897"><span class="ln">10897 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s nothing.’ The father turns back to the griddle.</span>
<a name="l10898"><span class="ln">10898 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Wet clothes aren’t helping.</span>
<a name="l10899"><span class="ln">10899 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie …’ He casts her a meaningful look.</span>
<a name="l10900"><span class="ln">10900 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie throws her hands in the air.</span>
<a name="l10901"><span class="ln">10901 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh, fine.’ She stabs a finger at him.</span>
<a name="l10902"><span class="ln">10902 </span></a><span class="s0">Or would he be?</span>
<a name="l10903"><span class="ln">10903 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not exactly a stranger any more.</span>
<a name="l10904"><span class="ln">10904 </span></a><span class="s0">He showed Jack how to do a backflip.</span>
<a name="l10905"><span class="ln">10905 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone tipped sand down his shirt.</span>
<a name="l10906"><span class="ln">10906 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s eaten their potato salad and worn their clothes.</span>
<a name="l10907"><span class="ln">10907 </span></a><span class="s0">The trouble is he stole it all, every moment.</span>
<a name="l10908"><span class="ln">10908 </span></a><span class="s0">And that’s the part people don’t overlook.</span>
<a name="l10909"><span class="ln">10909 </span></a><span class="s0">They feel betrayed.</span>
<a name="l10910"><span class="ln">10910 </span></a><span class="s0">Betrayed people have the hardest fists.</span>
<a name="l10911"><span class="ln">10911 </span></a><span class="s0">This whole family is really forceful.</span>
<a name="l10912"><span class="ln">10912 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But these are girls’ jeans …’ Sam starts.</span>
<a name="l10913"><span class="ln">10913 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie abruptly releases him and narrows her eyes.</span>
<a name="l10914"><span class="ln">10914 </span></a><span class="s0">‘If they don’t fit, then we’ll discuss,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l10915"><span class="ln">10915 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But they’re big on me anyway.</span>
<a name="l10916"><span class="ln">10916 </span></a><span class="s0">Towels under the sink.</span>
<a name="l10917"><span class="ln">10917 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Jeremy,’ she clarifies.</span>
<a name="l10918"><span class="ln">10918 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Jeremy does laundry.</span>
<a name="l10919"><span class="ln">10919 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack does yard work.</span>
<a name="l10920"><span class="ln">10920 </span></a><span class="s0">Grady is supposed to houseclean, but he whinges about allergies.</span>
<a name="l10921"><span class="ln">10921 </span></a><span class="s0">I look after the babies way too much.</span>
<a name="l10922"><span class="ln">10922 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That bruise looked pretty vicious.</span>
<a name="l10923"><span class="ln">10923 </span></a><span class="s0">What happened?’ Lies run through Sam’s head.</span>
<a name="l10924"><span class="ln">10924 </span></a><span class="s0">None tumble out of his mouth.</span>
<a name="l10925"><span class="ln">10925 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hmm,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l10926"><span class="ln">10926 </span></a><span class="s0">He gets a real hot shower.</span>
<a name="l10927"><span class="ln">10927 </span></a><span class="s0">With real soap.</span>
<a name="l10928"><span class="ln">10928 </span></a><span class="s0">He feels like Moxie chose it on purpose.</span>
<a name="l10929"><span class="ln">10929 </span></a><span class="s0">The tone downstairs is as worn out as he feels.</span>
<a name="l10930"><span class="ln">10930 </span></a><span class="s0">Then she slides it back to him.</span>
<a name="l10931"><span class="ln">10931 </span></a><span class="s0">‘The De Lainey special.</span>
<a name="l10932"><span class="ln">10932 </span></a><span class="s0">The rest of the little kids were my Uncle Robin’s.</span>
<a name="l10933"><span class="ln">10933 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Six hellion cousins there.</span>
<a name="l10934"><span class="ln">10934 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe she won’t think too hard about it?</span>
<a name="l10935"><span class="ln">10935 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No, Grady’s the oldest,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l10936"><span class="ln">10936 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy and Jack are next.</span>
<a name="l10937"><span class="ln">10937 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I heard that,’ Dash says.</span>
<a name="l10938"><span class="ln">10938 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie rolls her eyes.</span>
<a name="l10939"><span class="ln">10939 </span></a><span class="s0">So he’s left to slide a tentative question at her.</span>
<a name="l10940"><span class="ln">10940 </span></a><span class="s0">Not that he has any right to ask.</span>
<a name="l10941"><span class="ln">10941 </span></a><span class="s0">Not that he should be drawing attention to himself.</span>
<a name="l10942"><span class="ln">10942 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And you?’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l10943"><span class="ln">10943 </span></a><span class="s0">Grady uses a spoon as a bookmark and looks up.</span>
<a name="l10944"><span class="ln">10944 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam should leave before Moxie asks more questions.</span>
<a name="l10945"><span class="ln">10945 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam feels sick around adults.</span>
<a name="l10946"><span class="ln">10946 </span></a><span class="s0">But there are still waffles left and … well, waffles.</span>
<a name="l10947"><span class="ln">10947 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Wishful,’ their father says, ‘but no.</span>
<a name="l10948"><span class="ln">10948 </span></a><span class="s0">Absolutely not, Dad.’ ‘I’ll take the weekends,’ their father says.</span>
<a name="l10949"><span class="ln">10949 </span></a><span class="s0">Except that he is.</span>
<a name="l10950"><span class="ln">10950 </span></a><span class="s0">Her father’s voice stays unfailingly mild.</span>
<a name="l10951"><span class="ln">10951 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sweetie, I’m not trying to make it that way.</span>
<a name="l10952"><span class="ln">10952 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr De Lainey builds houses?</span>
<a name="l10953"><span class="ln">10953 </span></a><span class="s0">His heart beats a little faster.</span>
<a name="l10954"><span class="ln">10954 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Right, so we’re sorted?’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l10955"><span class="ln">10955 </span></a><span class="s0">Gotcha.’ Their father’s lips thin.</span>
<a name="l10956"><span class="ln">10956 </span></a><span class="s0">And we talked about this.</span>
<a name="l10957"><span class="ln">10957 </span></a><span class="s0">And there are …’ His voice thickens.</span>
<a name="l10958"><span class="ln">10958 </span></a><span class="s0">Grady immediately gathers plates and mumbles something about loving building.</span>
<a name="l10959"><span class="ln">10959 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You can knock off at three,’ his dad says.</span>
<a name="l10960"><span class="ln">10960 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Moxie.’ Their father gently nudges her shoulder.</span>
<a name="l10961"><span class="ln">10961 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Murmph.’ ‘Look, it’s just the babies.</span>
<a name="l10962"><span class="ln">10962 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’re going to make a film!</span>
<a name="l10963"><span class="ln">10963 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And I was going to work on my design portfolio.</span>
<a name="l10964"><span class="ln">10964 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m alone and broken.’ Her father starts clearing up plates.</span>
<a name="l10965"><span class="ln">10965 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You can still sew.</span>
<a name="l10966"><span class="ln">10966 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll take over as soon as I get home.</span>
<a name="l10967"><span class="ln">10967 </span></a><span class="s0">And when school starts, we’ll get the babies in daycare.</span>
<a name="l10968"><span class="ln">10968 </span></a><span class="s0">This deadline is a beast.’ ‘Fine.</span>
<a name="l10969"><span class="ln">10969 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sure your folks aren’t spoiling your summer plans, eh?</span>
<a name="l10970"><span class="ln">10970 </span></a><span class="s0">The lights flick off.</span>
<a name="l10971"><span class="ln">10971 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie flops on the sofa next to Sam.</span>
<a name="l10972"><span class="ln">10972 </span></a><span class="s0">It was the only available seat, he tells himself.</span>
<a name="l10973"><span class="ln">10973 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s why she sat next to him.</span>
<a name="l10974"><span class="ln">10974 </span></a><span class="s0">All at once.</span>
<a name="l10975"><span class="ln">10975 </span></a><span class="s0">Even though the movie seriously freaks him out.</span>
<a name="l10976"><span class="ln">10976 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s plenty of air.</span>
<a name="l10977"><span class="ln">10977 </span></a><span class="s0">But his lungs don’t quite work any more.</span>
<a name="l10978"><span class="ln">10978 </span></a><span class="s0">Stop twitching your fingers.</span>
<a name="l10979"><span class="ln">10979 </span></a><span class="s0">Like they’re seeing him, really seeing him.</span>
<a name="l10980"><span class="ln">10980 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam opens his mouth – to defend himself?</span>
<a name="l10981"><span class="ln">10981 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Did you see his face?</span>
<a name="l10982"><span class="ln">10982 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How is his hearing so good?’ Jeremy pats his shoulder.</span>
<a name="l10983"><span class="ln">10983 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Only for you and your swearing, buddy.</span>
<a name="l10984"><span class="ln">10984 </span></a><span class="s0">His face is so hot, his clothes so tight.</span>
<a name="l10985"><span class="ln">10985 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam wants to bury himself.</span>
<a name="l10986"><span class="ln">10986 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You nearly pissed yourself,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l10987"><span class="ln">10987 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy hits him.</span>
<a name="l10988"><span class="ln">10988 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie is still laughing silently, a hand over her mouth.</span>
<a name="l10989"><span class="ln">10989 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sorry.’ Her voice is soft as sand and sea.</span>
<a name="l10990"><span class="ln">10990 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I shouldn’t have laughed.</span>
<a name="l10991"><span class="ln">10991 </span></a><span class="s0">Pathetic, pathetic Sam.</span>
<a name="l10992"><span class="ln">10992 </span></a><span class="s0">‘There’s still part two,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l10993"><span class="ln">10993 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam might be sick.</span>
<a name="l10994"><span class="ln">10994 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s past eleven.’ Moxie licks popcorn salt off her thumb.</span>
<a name="l10995"><span class="ln">10995 </span></a><span class="s0">This is the part where Sam slips away.</span>
<a name="l10996"><span class="ln">10996 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll never have this again.</span>
<a name="l10997"><span class="ln">10997 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to leave.</span>
<a name="l10998"><span class="ln">10998 </span></a><span class="s0">Friends that Sam’s supposed to be leaving with.</span>
<a name="l10999"><span class="ln">10999 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam looks at the stairs.</span>
<a name="l11000"><span class="ln">11000 </span></a><span class="s0">He wouldn’t dare.</span>
<a name="l11001"><span class="ln">11001 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyes rest on Sam.</span>
<a name="l11002"><span class="ln">11002 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Thanks for coming, Sam,’ says Mr De Lainey.</span>
<a name="l11003"><span class="ln">11003 </span></a><span class="s0">He remembers Sam’s name?</span>

<a name="l11005"><span class="ln">11005 </span></a><span class="s0">You wouldn’t dare— Sam’s throat is tight.</span>
<a name="l11006"><span class="ln">11006 </span></a><span class="s0">He reaches for the kettle and a mug.</span>
<a name="l11007"><span class="ln">11007 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam bolts for the stairs.</span>
<a name="l11008"><span class="ln">11008 </span></a><span class="s0">No one will notice if he doesn’t come back downstairs.</span>
<a name="l11009"><span class="ln">11009 </span></a><span class="s0">No one will go into that office this late.</span>
<a name="l11010"><span class="ln">11010 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll leave tomorrow.</span>
<a name="l11011"><span class="ln">11011 </span></a><span class="s0">One last night that feels strangely like … home.</span>
<a name="l11012"><span class="ln">11012 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy is eight and it’s war at the kitchen table.</span>
<a name="l11013"><span class="ln">11013 </span></a><span class="s0">He gets overwhelmed and cries.</span>
<a name="l11014"><span class="ln">11014 </span></a><span class="s0">He gets that way about a lot of things.</span>
<a name="l11015"><span class="ln">11015 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s getting too much for Aunt Karen to pin down.</span>
<a name="l11016"><span class="ln">11016 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s why she’s on the phone.</span>
<a name="l11017"><span class="ln">11017 </span></a><span class="s0">‘—complete rubbish, Clay.</span>
<a name="l11018"><span class="ln">11018 </span></a><span class="s0">The phone call, however, he understands just fine.</span>
<a name="l11019"><span class="ln">11019 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not want these goddamn boys.</span>
<a name="l11020"><span class="ln">11020 </span></a><span class="s0">A forever scar.</span>
<a name="l11021"><span class="ln">11021 </span></a><span class="s0">Their aunt gives a frustrated shout and then goes silent.</span>
<a name="l11022"><span class="ln">11022 </span></a><span class="s0">She strides into the kitchen, all hard edges and splinters.</span>
<a name="l11023"><span class="ln">11023 </span></a><span class="s0">His ear still smarts from being caught and slapped too.</span>
<a name="l11024"><span class="ln">11024 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s legs freeze, mid-swing, shoelaces making a final clack.</span>
<a name="l11025"><span class="ln">11025 </span></a><span class="s0">Like Avery is trying to be difficult.</span>
<a name="l11026"><span class="ln">11026 </span></a><span class="s0">Frantic fluttering crawls up Sammy’s throat.</span>
<a name="l11027"><span class="ln">11027 </span></a><span class="s0">That can’t happen.</span>
<a name="l11028"><span class="ln">11028 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s Avery’s protector, his everything.</span>
<a name="l11029"><span class="ln">11029 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not listening.</span>
<a name="l11030"><span class="ln">11030 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s words come choked.</span>
<a name="l11031"><span class="ln">11031 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But, please, you c-can’t.</span>
<a name="l11032"><span class="ln">11032 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Fine.’ She stomps to the kitchen.</span>
<a name="l11033"><span class="ln">11033 </span></a><span class="s0">He loves those.</span>
<a name="l11034"><span class="ln">11034 </span></a><span class="s0">It hurts him.</span>
<a name="l11035"><span class="ln">11035 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy could tell her this if she listened.</span>
<a name="l11036"><span class="ln">11036 </span></a><span class="s0">If anyone listened.</span>
<a name="l11037"><span class="ln">11037 </span></a><span class="s0">But he is the invisible boy and no one cares.</span>
<a name="l11038"><span class="ln">11038 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s eyes widen.</span>
<a name="l11039"><span class="ln">11039 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen spins on Sammy.</span>
<a name="l11040"><span class="ln">11040 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Stay out there like animals then!’ The door slams.</span>
<a name="l11041"><span class="ln">11041 </span></a><span class="s0">The lock clicks.</span>
<a name="l11042"><span class="ln">11042 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re used to this, but it’s cold tonight.</span>
<a name="l11043"><span class="ln">11043 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s hands flutter.</span>
<a name="l11044"><span class="ln">11044 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I c-c-can’t—’ ‘I know.’ Sammy pets his arm.</span>
<a name="l11045"><span class="ln">11045 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Just let me think.</span>
<a name="l11046"><span class="ln">11046 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I could steal some tools.’ Excitement flickers in his voice.</span>
<a name="l11047"><span class="ln">11047 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I could steal some biscuits too.</span>
<a name="l11048"><span class="ln">11048 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyes are just sad.</span>
<a name="l11049"><span class="ln">11049 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Can you do that?’ Avery whispers.</span>
<a name="l11050"><span class="ln">11050 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Steal houses?’ ‘Yeah,’ Sammy says.</span>
<a name="l11051"><span class="ln">11051 </span></a><span class="s0">It sounds very traumatic.</span>
<a name="l11052"><span class="ln">11052 </span></a><span class="s0">The two little kids are tag-team crying.</span>
<a name="l11053"><span class="ln">11053 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack and Moxie lock in a shouting match.</span>
<a name="l11054"><span class="ln">11054 </span></a><span class="s0">No one can find car keys.</span>
<a name="l11055"><span class="ln">11055 </span></a><span class="s0">Dash says she’s leaving home.</span>
<a name="l11056"><span class="ln">11056 </span></a><span class="s0">Goodbyes are hollered.</span>
<a name="l11057"><span class="ln">11057 </span></a><span class="s0">The front door slams.</span>
<a name="l11058"><span class="ln">11058 </span></a><span class="s0">Engines fade down the road.</span>
<a name="l11059"><span class="ln">11059 </span></a><span class="s0">He picks up.</span>
<a name="l11060"><span class="ln">11060 </span></a><span class="s0">Puts it back.</span>
<a name="l11061"><span class="ln">11061 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s obviously saving this for worst-case scenarios.</span>
<a name="l11062"><span class="ln">11062 </span></a><span class="s0">But Sam is a thief.</span>
<a name="l11063"><span class="ln">11063 </span></a><span class="s0">This is what he does, isn’t it?</span>
<a name="l11064"><span class="ln">11064 </span></a><span class="s0">He pokes his head out the door.</span>
<a name="l11065"><span class="ln">11065 </span></a><span class="s0">The house is suddenly quiet.</span>
<a name="l11066"><span class="ln">11066 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam slips across the hall and peeks through the stairwell.</span>
<a name="l11067"><span class="ln">11067 </span></a><span class="s0">A De Laineyflavoured explosion has hit.</span>
<a name="l11068"><span class="ln">11068 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Quit it, Toby,’ she orders.</span>
<a name="l11069"><span class="ln">11069 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re having a bath.</span>
<a name="l11070"><span class="ln">11070 </span></a><span class="s0">Water turns on.</span>
<a name="l11071"><span class="ln">11071 </span></a><span class="s0">Toby howls like he’s being murdered.</span>
<a name="l11072"><span class="ln">11072 </span></a><span class="s0">The baby toddles after them, cradling a pot of jam.</span>
<a name="l11073"><span class="ln">11073 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s getaway path is clear.</span>
<a name="l11074"><span class="ln">11074 </span></a><span class="s0">Except he doesn’t want to get away.</span>
<a name="l11075"><span class="ln">11075 </span></a><span class="s0">But he can’t stay.</span>
<a name="l11076"><span class="ln">11076 </span></a><span class="s0">And also because Avery might be gone.</span>
<a name="l11077"><span class="ln">11077 </span></a><span class="s0">Where else can Sam go?</span>
<a name="l11078"><span class="ln">11078 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks like trouble.</span>
<a name="l11079"><span class="ln">11079 </span></a><span class="s0">The De Lainey cash just slips through his fingers.</span>
<a name="l11080"><span class="ln">11080 </span></a><span class="s0">This is his life.</span>
<a name="l11081"><span class="ln">11081 </span></a><span class="s0">Steal and spend and stay alive.</span>
<a name="l11082"><span class="ln">11082 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam usually comes in the back, but not today.</span>
<a name="l11083"><span class="ln">11083 </span></a><span class="s0">Which is why, distracted, he walks straight into the boss.</span>
<a name="l11084"><span class="ln">11084 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sammy Lou.’ He has a voice like old engines.</span>
<a name="l11085"><span class="ln">11085 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s still here.</span>
<a name="l11086"><span class="ln">11086 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sorry,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l11087"><span class="ln">11087 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You know what’s breaking around here?</span>
<a name="l11088"><span class="ln">11088 </span></a><span class="s0">My mind on why I kept that kid on.</span>
<a name="l11089"><span class="ln">11089 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s practised this look for maximum patheticness.</span>
<a name="l11090"><span class="ln">11090 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m really sorry for distracting him.</span>
<a name="l11091"><span class="ln">11091 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Just don’t distract him.</span>
<a name="l11092"><span class="ln">11092 </span></a><span class="s0">So Avery got his second chance.</span>
<a name="l11093"><span class="ln">11093 </span></a><span class="s0">His bare arms are stick thin and smeared with grease.</span>
<a name="l11094"><span class="ln">11094 </span></a><span class="s0">Is that about their fight?</span>
<a name="l11095"><span class="ln">11095 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You stayed,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l11096"><span class="ln">11096 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What?’ Avery pauses, arms half lost in the engine.</span>
<a name="l11097"><span class="ln">11097 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What are you talking about?’ ‘The other night?</span>
<a name="l11098"><span class="ln">11098 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s eyes narrow.</span>
<a name="l11099"><span class="ln">11099 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That was just talk.</span>
<a name="l11100"><span class="ln">11100 </span></a><span class="s0">Does my boss know you’re here?</span>
<a name="l11101"><span class="ln">11101 </span></a><span class="s0">So Avery knows what Sam did.</span>
<a name="l11102"><span class="ln">11102 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh, he definitely knows.</span>
<a name="l11103"><span class="ln">11103 </span></a><span class="s0">And this is all Avery’s fault anyway, right?</span>
<a name="l11104"><span class="ln">11104 </span></a><span class="s0">You need this job.’ ‘That was an accident.</span>
<a name="l11105"><span class="ln">11105 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam bites back his pained whimper.</span>
<a name="l11106"><span class="ln">11106 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s voice rises.</span>
<a name="l11107"><span class="ln">11107 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You meant to break someone’s hand.</span>
<a name="l11108"><span class="ln">11108 </span></a><span class="s0">I hate it.</span>
<a name="l11109"><span class="ln">11109 </span></a><span class="s0">Agonising heat flushes Sam’s cheeks.</span>
<a name="l11110"><span class="ln">11110 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants to shove him back, but he can’t.</span>
<a name="l11111"><span class="ln">11111 </span></a><span class="s0">He’d never touch Avery to hurt him.</span>
<a name="l11112"><span class="ln">11112 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You need this job.’ Sam’s voice is low.</span>
<a name="l11113"><span class="ln">11113 </span></a><span class="s0">But his breathing evens out.</span>
<a name="l11114"><span class="ln">11114 </span></a><span class="s0">Shut up about it.’ Avery’s teeth clench.</span>
<a name="l11115"><span class="ln">11115 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I mean it.</span>
<a name="l11116"><span class="ln">11116 </span></a><span class="s0">It drives Sam mad, because Avery is good with engines.</span>
<a name="l11117"><span class="ln">11117 </span></a><span class="s0">But he has to stay calm.</span>
<a name="l11118"><span class="ln">11118 </span></a><span class="s0">Not get overwhelmed.</span>
<a name="l11119"><span class="ln">11119 </span></a><span class="s0">Not let anyone see him freak out.</span>
<a name="l11120"><span class="ln">11120 </span></a><span class="s0">The police must not find the Lou brothers.</span>
<a name="l11121"><span class="ln">11121 </span></a><span class="s0">After what Sam did at school last year?</span>
<a name="l11122"><span class="ln">11122 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam wants to shout: Look, Avery!</span>
<a name="l11123"><span class="ln">11123 </span></a><span class="s0">This is exactly why you can’t be alone!</span>
<a name="l11124"><span class="ln">11124 </span></a><span class="s0">Who’d calm you down if I wasn’t here?</span>
<a name="l11125"><span class="ln">11125 </span></a><span class="s0">This is what brothers do.</span>
<a name="l11126"><span class="ln">11126 </span></a><span class="s0">He fiddles with a loose thread on his jeans.</span>
<a name="l11127"><span class="ln">11127 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t believe he forgot to change.</span>
<a name="l11128"><span class="ln">11128 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll add it to their savings.</span>
<a name="l11129"><span class="ln">11129 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Can we not fight?’ Sam whispers.</span>
<a name="l11130"><span class="ln">11130 </span></a><span class="s0">‘S-stop hurting people.</span>
<a name="l11131"><span class="ln">11131 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Then stop screwing up,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l11132"><span class="ln">11132 </span></a><span class="s0">No one looks twice.</span>
<a name="l11133"><span class="ln">11133 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re here to work.</span>
<a name="l11134"><span class="ln">11134 </span></a><span class="s0">He clearly doesn’t trust Avery alone in the workshop.</span>
<a name="l11135"><span class="ln">11135 </span></a><span class="s0">Which ends up with the Lou brothers analysing tourist targets.</span>
<a name="l11136"><span class="ln">11136 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone happy or affectionate.</span>
<a name="l11137"><span class="ln">11137 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone who’ll care.</span>
<a name="l11138"><span class="ln">11138 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery gives him a sour look.</span>
<a name="l11139"><span class="ln">11139 </span></a><span class="s0">He could use a bath.</span>
<a name="l11140"><span class="ln">11140 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam still has on the smiley-face shirt and Moxie’s jeans.</span>
<a name="l11141"><span class="ln">11141 </span></a><span class="s0">Does she wonder about him?</span>
<a name="l11142"><span class="ln">11142 </span></a><span class="s0">Why’s he even thinking that?</span>
<a name="l11143"><span class="ln">11143 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam rubs the back of his sweaty neck.</span>
<a name="l11144"><span class="ln">11144 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well, we can’t do the one where you fake-vomit.</span>
<a name="l11145"><span class="ln">11145 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m hitting, you’re running.’ Sam gives him a flat look.</span>
<a name="l11146"><span class="ln">11146 </span></a><span class="s0">Obviously that’s how they divide the parts.</span>
<a name="l11147"><span class="ln">11147 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t even fake hitting Avery.</span>
<a name="l11148"><span class="ln">11148 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Stop calling them “jobs”.</span>
<a name="l11149"><span class="ln">11149 </span></a><span class="s0">What do think this is?</span>
<a name="l11150"><span class="ln">11150 </span></a><span class="s0">Like it’s sliding.</span>
<a name="l11151"><span class="ln">11151 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants to catch it before someone falls.</span>
<a name="l11152"><span class="ln">11152 </span></a><span class="s0">He puts it in the bin.</span>
<a name="l11153"><span class="ln">11153 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery stands, anticipation in his jittering arms.</span>
<a name="l11154"><span class="ln">11154 </span></a><span class="s0">Their handbag isn’t quite zipped.</span>
<a name="l11155"><span class="ln">11155 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s hand is in and out before he stands up.</span>
<a name="l11156"><span class="ln">11156 </span></a><span class="s0">Right on the bruise.</span>
<a name="l11157"><span class="ln">11157 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s wince is real.</span>
<a name="l11158"><span class="ln">11158 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You want to run that by me again?’ Avery shouts.</span>
<a name="l11159"><span class="ln">11159 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam slaps his hand away.</span>
<a name="l11160"><span class="ln">11160 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey, take it easy.’ He’s not faking, though.</span>
<a name="l11161"><span class="ln">11161 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s a little too into it today.</span>
<a name="l11162"><span class="ln">11162 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Shut the hell up!’ Avery shoves him again.</span>
<a name="l11163"><span class="ln">11163 </span></a><span class="s0">His neck snaps to the side.</span>
<a name="l11164"><span class="ln">11164 </span></a><span class="s0">His teeth sink into his tongue.</span>
<a name="l11165"><span class="ln">11165 </span></a><span class="s0">His vision fractures.</span>
<a name="l11166"><span class="ln">11166 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery really really forgot to fake that punch.</span>
<a name="l11167"><span class="ln">11167 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood dribbles down his chin.</span>
<a name="l11168"><span class="ln">11168 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone gives a heartfelt gasp.</span>
<a name="l11169"><span class="ln">11169 </span></a><span class="s0">People back off and stare.</span>
<a name="l11170"><span class="ln">11170 </span></a><span class="s0">Voices flood over Sam.</span>
<a name="l11171"><span class="ln">11171 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m fine.’ The words slur without trying.</span>
<a name="l11172"><span class="ln">11172 </span></a><span class="s0">His hand darts toward a back pocket.</span>
<a name="l11173"><span class="ln">11173 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone gives a grateful cry.</span>
<a name="l11174"><span class="ln">11174 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Here comes a security guard!’ Sam’s body tenses.</span>
<a name="l11175"><span class="ln">11175 </span></a><span class="s0">They need to run now.</span>
<a name="l11176"><span class="ln">11176 </span></a><span class="s0">But she’s paused, wipes halfway to the baby’s face.</span>
<a name="l11177"><span class="ln">11177 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie stares at him.</span>
<a name="l11178"><span class="ln">11178 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam jerks away.</span>
<a name="l11179"><span class="ln">11179 </span></a><span class="s0">Did she see his face?</span>
<a name="l11180"><span class="ln">11180 </span></a><span class="s0">She wouldn’t have.</span>
<a name="l11181"><span class="ln">11181 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s Sam’s fault.</span>
<a name="l11182"><span class="ln">11182 </span></a><span class="s0">He let himself get distracted.</span>
<a name="l11183"><span class="ln">11183 </span></a><span class="s0">They should be gone by now.</span>

<a name="l11185"><span class="ln">11185 </span></a><span class="s0">Hey!’ The person lunges at him.</span>
<a name="l11186"><span class="ln">11186 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam tips two fingers in salute and then— runs.</span>
<a name="l11187"><span class="ln">11187 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he’s gone.</span>
<a name="l11188"><span class="ln">11188 </span></a><span class="s0">He never looks back to see if Sam made it.</span>
<a name="l11189"><span class="ln">11189 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam takes care of himself.</span>
<a name="l11190"><span class="ln">11190 </span></a><span class="s0">The security guard chases, shouting into his walkie-talkie.</span>
<a name="l11191"><span class="ln">11191 </span></a><span class="s0">Noise runs over his back.</span>
<a name="l11192"><span class="ln">11192 </span></a><span class="s0">Bodies shove him out the way.</span>
<a name="l11193"><span class="ln">11193 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s lost in a crowd.</span>
<a name="l11194"><span class="ln">11194 </span></a><span class="s0">The last wallet is still in his hand.</span>
<a name="l11195"><span class="ln">11195 </span></a><span class="s0">Not a bad haul.</span>
<a name="l11196"><span class="ln">11196 </span></a><span class="s0">He walks and flips through them.</span>
<a name="l11197"><span class="ln">11197 </span></a><span class="s0">The second is a fat tourist wallet.</span>
<a name="l11198"><span class="ln">11198 </span></a><span class="s0">Fifties and twenties.</span>
<a name="l11199"><span class="ln">11199 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he drops that wallet in a flowerbed.</span>
<a name="l11200"><span class="ln">11200 </span></a><span class="s0">If he can find Avery.</span>
<a name="l11201"><span class="ln">11201 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers press gently at his jaw.</span>
<a name="l11202"><span class="ln">11202 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s not like that’s usual for him, right?</span>
<a name="l11203"><span class="ln">11203 </span></a><span class="s0">But this is Avery.</span>
<a name="l11204"><span class="ln">11204 </span></a><span class="s0">He hates hitting.</span>
<a name="l11205"><span class="ln">11205 </span></a><span class="s0">It doesn’t matter.</span>
<a name="l11206"><span class="ln">11206 </span></a><span class="s0">She’s nobody to him.</span>
<a name="l11207"><span class="ln">11207 </span></a><span class="s0">But he keeps looking.</span>
<a name="l11208"><span class="ln">11208 </span></a><span class="s0">And he sees her again.</span>
<a name="l11209"><span class="ln">11209 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie De Lainey.</span>
<a name="l11210"><span class="ln">11210 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam wonders if she’s talking about him.</span>
<a name="l11211"><span class="ln">11211 </span></a><span class="s0">Yeah sure, Sam.</span>
<a name="l11212"><span class="ln">11212 </span></a><span class="s0">The entire world revolves around you.</span>
<a name="l11213"><span class="ln">11213 </span></a><span class="s0">She probably (definitely) didn’t recognise you.</span>
<a name="l11214"><span class="ln">11214 </span></a><span class="s0">She probably (definitely) didn’t care.</span>
<a name="l11215"><span class="ln">11215 </span></a><span class="s0">STOP.’ Sam’s fingers freeze.</span>
<a name="l11216"><span class="ln">11216 </span></a><span class="s0">His head snaps up.</span>

<a name="l11219"><span class="ln">11219 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s shoes hit the road.</span>
<a name="l11220"><span class="ln">11220 </span></a><span class="s0">He twists so his back is to the oncoming car.</span>
<a name="l11221"><span class="ln">11221 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Moxie,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l11222"><span class="ln">11222 </span></a><span class="s0">Just a whisper.</span>
<a name="l11223"><span class="ln">11223 </span></a><span class="s0">Just a breath.</span>
<a name="l11224"><span class="ln">11224 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s all happened so fast.</span>
<a name="l11225"><span class="ln">11225 </span></a><span class="s0">No chance to think.</span>
<a name="l11226"><span class="ln">11226 </span></a><span class="s0">A horn blasts.</span>
<a name="l11227"><span class="ln">11227 </span></a><span class="s0">Undone shoelaces twist around Sam’s ankles.</span>
<a name="l11228"><span class="ln">11228 </span></a><span class="s0">He takes a breath.</span>
<a name="l11229"><span class="ln">11229 </span></a><span class="s0">The car hits.</span>
<a name="l11230"><span class="ln">11230 </span></a><span class="s0">Then the world stammers to an abrupt halt.</span>
<a name="l11231"><span class="ln">11231 </span></a><span class="s0">It doesn’t hurt.</span>
<a name="l11232"><span class="ln">11232 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t care.</span>
<a name="l11233"><span class="ln">11233 </span></a><span class="s0">Car doors slam.</span>
<a name="l11234"><span class="ln">11234 </span></a><span class="s0">Voices rise in panicked flurry.</span>
<a name="l11235"><span class="ln">11235 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood, hot and thick and metallic, coats Sam’s arms.</span>
<a name="l11236"><span class="ln">11236 </span></a><span class="s0">He pushes himself up.</span>
<a name="l11237"><span class="ln">11237 </span></a><span class="s0">Let me call an ambulance—’ The driver is sobbing.</span>
<a name="l11238"><span class="ln">11238 </span></a><span class="s0">Someone has a phone out, frantically dialling.</span>
<a name="l11239"><span class="ln">11239 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No.’ Sam tastes hot bitumen, salty blood.</span>
<a name="l11240"><span class="ln">11240 </span></a><span class="s0">He scrambles to his feet.</span>
<a name="l11241"><span class="ln">11241 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks for Moxie.</span>
<a name="l11242"><span class="ln">11242 </span></a><span class="s0">Their backs are to Sam.</span>
<a name="l11243"><span class="ln">11243 </span></a><span class="s0">Their father’s shoulders shake.</span>
<a name="l11244"><span class="ln">11244 </span></a><span class="s0">But there’s not a scratch on the little boy.</span>
<a name="l11245"><span class="ln">11245 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam clutches at the car hood for a second.</span>
<a name="l11246"><span class="ln">11246 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m fine.’ Moxie looks up over her father’s shoulder.</span>
<a name="l11247"><span class="ln">11247 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam turns away.</span>
<a name="l11248"><span class="ln">11248 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s fine, he’s fine fine fine.</span>
<a name="l11249"><span class="ln">11249 </span></a><span class="s0">His body screams so he just runs faster.</span>
<a name="l11250"><span class="ln">11250 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood slicks down his arms.</span>
<a name="l11251"><span class="ln">11251 </span></a><span class="s0">Just get away.</span>
<a name="l11252"><span class="ln">11252 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t let people see.</span>
<a name="l11253"><span class="ln">11253 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t let them notice.</span>
<a name="l11254"><span class="ln">11254 </span></a><span class="s0">The footpath ends here.</span>
<a name="l11255"><span class="ln">11255 </span></a><span class="s0">He sinks into the gutter, grabbing his stomach.</span>
<a name="l11256"><span class="ln">11256 </span></a><span class="s0">The ground pulses and agony flashes in his guts.</span>
<a name="l11257"><span class="ln">11257 </span></a><span class="s0">He puts his head between his legs and vomits.</span>
<a name="l11258"><span class="ln">11258 </span></a><span class="s0">Tears spill next, hot and fat down his cheeks.</span>
<a name="l11259"><span class="ln">11259 </span></a><span class="s0">A shadow falls over his head.</span>
<a name="l11260"><span class="ln">11260 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Whoa,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l11261"><span class="ln">11261 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sammy.’ His voice is high and panicked.</span>
<a name="l11262"><span class="ln">11262 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What the hell, Sammy?</span>
<a name="l11263"><span class="ln">11263 </span></a><span class="s0">You could’ve died!</span>
<a name="l11264"><span class="ln">11264 </span></a><span class="s0">Why would you even – you idiot.</span>
<a name="l11265"><span class="ln">11265 </span></a><span class="s0">You cc-could’ve died!</span>
<a name="l11266"><span class="ln">11266 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam hurts he hurts he hurts.</span>
<a name="l11267"><span class="ln">11267 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I don’t need a hospital.</span>
<a name="l11268"><span class="ln">11268 </span></a><span class="s0">Shut up, OK?</span>
<a name="l11269"><span class="ln">11269 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re lying.’ Sam glances sideways at him.</span>
<a name="l11270"><span class="ln">11270 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s hands spin as he crouches by Sam.</span>
<a name="l11271"><span class="ln">11271 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Avery,’ he whispers, ‘it was a little kid.</span>
<a name="l11272"><span class="ln">11272 </span></a><span class="s0">So just shut up.’ Avery grabs Sam’s shoulder.</span>
<a name="l11273"><span class="ln">11273 </span></a><span class="s0">We’ll go to my friend’s place.’ Oh, great.</span>
<a name="l11274"><span class="ln">11274 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No,’ Sam says, voice rough.</span>
<a name="l11275"><span class="ln">11275 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I don’t like them.’ ‘What?</span>
<a name="l11276"><span class="ln">11276 </span></a><span class="s0">‘She’ll call the police on us.</span>
<a name="l11277"><span class="ln">11277 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You don’t understand a single freaking thing.</span>
<a name="l11278"><span class="ln">11278 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyes go blank, guttered out.</span>
<a name="l11279"><span class="ln">11279 </span></a><span class="s0">When their dad hit him.</span>
<a name="l11280"><span class="ln">11280 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery just shuts down.</span>
<a name="l11281"><span class="ln">11281 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam has never made him do that before.</span>
<a name="l11282"><span class="ln">11282 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery rises and skitters back.</span>
<a name="l11283"><span class="ln">11283 </span></a><span class="s0">And he runs.</span>
<a name="l11284"><span class="ln">11284 </span></a><span class="s0">Anger suddenly whitens behind Sam’s eyes.</span>
<a name="l11285"><span class="ln">11285 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam shoves to his feet and limps down the street.</span>
<a name="l11286"><span class="ln">11286 </span></a><span class="s0">People stare, but he focuses ahead.</span>
<a name="l11287"><span class="ln">11287 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks over his shoulder.</span>
<a name="l11288"><span class="ln">11288 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery hasn’t come back.</span>
<a name="l11289"><span class="ln">11289 </span></a><span class="s0">Because it hurts.</span>
<a name="l11290"><span class="ln">11290 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s the only reason.</span>
<a name="l11291"><span class="ln">11291 </span></a><span class="s0">No one notices Sam.</span>
<a name="l11292"><span class="ln">11292 </span></a><span class="s0">Obviously he should go steal another house.</span>
<a name="l11293"><span class="ln">11293 </span></a><span class="s0">But he’s not staked anything out.</span>
<a name="l11294"><span class="ln">11294 </span></a><span class="s0">It could take for ever to find one.</span>
<a name="l11295"><span class="ln">11295 </span></a><span class="s0">And he hurts.</span>
<a name="l11296"><span class="ln">11296 </span></a><span class="s0">He hurts too much to pick a lock.</span>
<a name="l11297"><span class="ln">11297 </span></a><span class="s0">He hurts too much to rob a family.</span>
<a name="l11298"><span class="ln">11298 </span></a><span class="s0">He hurts too much to breathe.</span>
<a name="l11299"><span class="ln">11299 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s not an option.</span>
<a name="l11300"><span class="ln">11300 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t even know them.</span>
<a name="l11301"><span class="ln">11301 </span></a><span class="s0">They don’t know him.</span>
<a name="l11302"><span class="ln">11302 </span></a><span class="s0">They wouldn’t want to know him.</span>
<a name="l11303"><span class="ln">11303 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam can’t just sneak back in.</span>
<a name="l11304"><span class="ln">11304 </span></a><span class="s0">If you count how he hits things.</span>
<a name="l11305"><span class="ln">11305 </span></a><span class="s0">He wonders if Moxie is back.</span>
<a name="l11306"><span class="ln">11306 </span></a><span class="s0">If she recognised him.</span>
<a name="l11307"><span class="ln">11307 </span></a><span class="s0">If Toby is really all right.</span>
<a name="l11308"><span class="ln">11308 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t just go in.</span>
<a name="l11309"><span class="ln">11309 </span></a><span class="s0">Unless … Unless he says he’s Moxie’s friend.</span>
<a name="l11310"><span class="ln">11310 </span></a><span class="s0">Depends on who’s asking.</span>
<a name="l11311"><span class="ln">11311 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to come up with a story.</span>
<a name="l11312"><span class="ln">11312 </span></a><span class="s0">He … fell?</span>
<a name="l11313"><span class="ln">11313 </span></a><span class="s0">Good one, Sam.</span>
<a name="l11314"><span class="ln">11314 </span></a><span class="s0">No one will see through that.</span>
<a name="l11315"><span class="ln">11315 </span></a><span class="s0">You want to con someone?</span>
<a name="l11316"><span class="ln">11316 </span></a><span class="s0">Like they’re expecting him.</span>
<a name="l11317"><span class="ln">11317 </span></a><span class="s0">It hurts to stand straight, but he’ll do it.</span>
<a name="l11318"><span class="ln">11318 </span></a><span class="s0">The front door is already open.</span>
<a name="l11319"><span class="ln">11319 </span></a><span class="s0">He raps knuckles on the doorframe.</span>
<a name="l11320"><span class="ln">11320 </span></a><span class="s0">A hand shoots up from the sofa and waves vaguely.</span>
<a name="l11321"><span class="ln">11321 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Come in,’ says a tired voice.</span>
<a name="l11322"><span class="ln">11322 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Unless you’re an axe murderer.</span>
<a name="l11323"><span class="ln">11323 </span></a><span class="s0">Then stay out or whatever.’ ‘Wow, Jeremy.</span>
<a name="l11324"><span class="ln">11324 </span></a><span class="s0">That was convincing.</span>
<a name="l11325"><span class="ln">11325 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam steps in, muscles coiled.</span>
<a name="l11326"><span class="ln">11326 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s Sam.’ Jeremy’s head pops up from behind the sofa.</span>
<a name="l11327"><span class="ln">11327 </span></a><span class="s0">A soft grin spreads across his face.</span>
<a name="l11328"><span class="ln">11328 </span></a><span class="s0">Here for Moxie?’ Sam comes in a little further.</span>
<a name="l11329"><span class="ln">11329 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s committed now, isn’t he?</span>
<a name="l11330"><span class="ln">11330 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh, right.’ Jeremy flops back down.</span>
<a name="l11331"><span class="ln">11331 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t see Sam at all now.</span>
<a name="l11332"><span class="ln">11332 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Moxie is out,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l11333"><span class="ln">11333 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dad’s bribing her with gelato.</span>
<a name="l11334"><span class="ln">11334 </span></a><span class="s0">Favouritism.’ ‘They’ll be back soon, though,’ Jeremy adds.</span>
<a name="l11335"><span class="ln">11335 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam realises they don’t know what happened to Toby.</span>
<a name="l11336"><span class="ln">11336 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s been an hour, maybe two, and Moxie hasn’t returned.</span>
<a name="l11337"><span class="ln">11337 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe Toby is actually hurt?</span>
<a name="l11338"><span class="ln">11338 </span></a><span class="s0">He slips towards the staircase.</span>
<a name="l11339"><span class="ln">11339 </span></a><span class="s0">His heart rabbits so fast he can scarcely think.</span>
<a name="l11340"><span class="ln">11340 </span></a><span class="s0">What the hell is he doing?</span>
<a name="l11341"><span class="ln">11341 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t just … he can’t be doing this.</span>
<a name="l11342"><span class="ln">11342 </span></a><span class="s0">But he is.</span>
<a name="l11343"><span class="ln">11343 </span></a><span class="s0">Buckets of bath toys block the way to the sink.</span>
<a name="l11344"><span class="ln">11344 </span></a><span class="s0">He presses that to his side and nearly passes out.</span>
<a name="l11345"><span class="ln">11345 </span></a><span class="s0">When is he going to grow some freaking brains?</span>
<a name="l11346"><span class="ln">11346 </span></a><span class="s0">Like the glorious idiot he is.</span>
<a name="l11347"><span class="ln">11347 </span></a><span class="s0">The vacuum shuts off.</span>
<a name="l11348"><span class="ln">11348 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Jack!’ Grady shouts.</span>
<a name="l11349"><span class="ln">11349 </span></a><span class="s0">Clean it up.</span>
<a name="l11350"><span class="ln">11350 </span></a><span class="s0">Now.’ Jeremy’s voice drifts from downstairs, sweet and innocent.</span>
<a name="l11351"><span class="ln">11351 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t be insensitive, bro.</span>
<a name="l11352"><span class="ln">11352 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I am so sick of both of you,’ Grady hollers.</span>
<a name="l11353"><span class="ln">11353 </span></a><span class="s0">Please go downstairs.</span>
<a name="l11354"><span class="ln">11354 </span></a><span class="s0">He clicks the office door shut.</span>
<a name="l11355"><span class="ln">11355 </span></a><span class="s0">And he’s alone.</span>
<a name="l11356"><span class="ln">11356 </span></a><span class="s0">It’ll end badly.</span>
<a name="l11357"><span class="ln">11357 </span></a><span class="s0">If someone bursts in here, what would he do?</span>
<a name="l11358"><span class="ln">11358 </span></a><span class="s0">Sink to his knees and cry.</span>
<a name="l11359"><span class="ln">11359 </span></a><span class="s0">The noise downstairs suddenly escalates and Sam’s shoulders tighten.</span>
<a name="l11360"><span class="ln">11360 </span></a><span class="s0">A baby shrieks.</span>
<a name="l11361"><span class="ln">11361 </span></a><span class="s0">Toby really is fine.</span>
<a name="l11362"><span class="ln">11362 </span></a><span class="s0">‘—hit by a car,’ Moxie is saying.</span>
<a name="l11363"><span class="ln">11363 </span></a><span class="s0">Voices mix and tumble.</span>
<a name="l11364"><span class="ln">11364 </span></a><span class="s0">Hit Jeremy with it.’ ‘—no, the baby’s fine.</span>
<a name="l11365"><span class="ln">11365 </span></a><span class="s0">He cracks open the office door to hear better.</span>
<a name="l11366"><span class="ln">11366 </span></a><span class="s0">And then he’ll have to run again.</span>

<a name="l11374"><span class="ln">11374 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe he walked home alone?</span>
<a name="l11375"><span class="ln">11375 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s not even sure he could without getting lost.</span>
<a name="l11376"><span class="ln">11376 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy runs the whole way, tattered backpack punching his spine.</span>
<a name="l11377"><span class="ln">11377 </span></a><span class="s0">He dumps it by their letterbox and runs inside.</span>
<a name="l11378"><span class="ln">11378 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Where’s Avery?’ he gasps.</span>
<a name="l11379"><span class="ln">11379 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen flicks her cigarette in the sink.</span>

<a name="l11389"><span class="ln">11389 </span></a><span class="s0">He goes to the park, full of prickles and rubbish.</span>
<a name="l11390"><span class="ln">11390 </span></a><span class="s0">He flies across footpaths.</span>
<a name="l11391"><span class="ln">11391 </span></a><span class="s0">To the shops.</span>
<a name="l11392"><span class="ln">11392 </span></a><span class="s0">Back to school.</span>
<a name="l11393"><span class="ln">11393 </span></a><span class="s0">Back to the streets.</span>
<a name="l11394"><span class="ln">11394 </span></a><span class="s0">The air chills and smells of car exhaust and loneliness.</span>
<a name="l11395"><span class="ln">11395 </span></a><span class="s0">He runs anyway.</span>
<a name="l11396"><span class="ln">11396 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy trails, dejected and exhausted, back to his street.</span>
<a name="l11397"><span class="ln">11397 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery could be dead.</span>
<a name="l11398"><span class="ln">11398 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s all Sammy’s fault.</span>

<a name="l11405"><span class="ln">11405 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s running his toy car up and down his face.</span>
<a name="l11406"><span class="ln">11406 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey, whoa there, little mate.</span>
<a name="l11407"><span class="ln">11407 </span></a><span class="s0">This is your brother?’ ‘I’m Sammy Lou,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l11408"><span class="ln">11408 </span></a><span class="s0">He has a split lip, but he smiles anyway.</span>
<a name="l11409"><span class="ln">11409 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’re bringing your brother home.</span>
<a name="l11410"><span class="ln">11410 </span></a><span class="s0">Not taking him away.’ Sammy thinks he might cry.</span>
<a name="l11411"><span class="ln">11411 </span></a><span class="s0">He will not cry.</span>
<a name="l11412"><span class="ln">11412 </span></a><span class="s0">There are folded arms and frowns.</span>
<a name="l11413"><span class="ln">11413 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Come on, little mate,’ says the cop.</span>
<a name="l11414"><span class="ln">11414 </span></a><span class="s0">Digging in like a bite.</span>
<a name="l11415"><span class="ln">11415 </span></a><span class="s0">Like a barnacle.</span>
<a name="l11416"><span class="ln">11416 </span></a><span class="s0">The cop staggers in surprise, and then laughs.</span>
<a name="l11417"><span class="ln">11417 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy hops after them, teeth chattering.</span>
<a name="l11418"><span class="ln">11418 </span></a><span class="s0">They must’ve been so, so nice to him.</span>
<a name="l11419"><span class="ln">11419 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen’s face is stony as they arrive.</span>
<a name="l11420"><span class="ln">11420 </span></a><span class="s0">The cop’s cut lip.</span>
<a name="l11421"><span class="ln">11421 </span></a><span class="s0">You can’t hit a cop.</span>
<a name="l11422"><span class="ln">11422 </span></a><span class="s0">He didn’t mean to.’ The woman gives a small smile.</span>
<a name="l11423"><span class="ln">11423 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ah, you must be Sammy.</span>
<a name="l11424"><span class="ln">11424 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery needed him and he wasn’t there.</span>
<a name="l11425"><span class="ln">11425 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Please,’ Sammy whispers.</span>
<a name="l11426"><span class="ln">11426 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He wasn’t gone for that long.’ ‘Five hours,’ Sammy says.</span>
<a name="l11427"><span class="ln">11427 </span></a><span class="s0">His aunt shoots him a poisoned look.</span>
<a name="l11428"><span class="ln">11428 </span></a><span class="s0">The lady cop folds her arms.</span>
<a name="l11429"><span class="ln">11429 </span></a><span class="s0">And Aunt Karen has to listen.</span>
<a name="l11430"><span class="ln">11430 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Come on, kiddo, home now.</span>
<a name="l11431"><span class="ln">11431 </span></a><span class="s0">Safe and sound.’ Finally Avery lets go.</span>
<a name="l11432"><span class="ln">11432 </span></a><span class="s0">Too old for cars.</span>
<a name="l11433"><span class="ln">11433 </span></a><span class="s0">Too old to be carried.</span>
<a name="l11434"><span class="ln">11434 </span></a><span class="s0">Too old not to know his way home.</span>
<a name="l11435"><span class="ln">11435 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy nearly smiles.</span>
<a name="l11436"><span class="ln">11436 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m lost,’ Avery whispers.</span>
<a name="l11437"><span class="ln">11437 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Not any more.’ Sammy casts damp eyes to the cop.</span>
<a name="l11438"><span class="ln">11438 </span></a><span class="s0">He tucks his hands behind his back.</span>
<a name="l11439"><span class="ln">11439 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No.’ The cop raises an eyebrow.</span>
<a name="l11440"><span class="ln">11440 </span></a><span class="s0">‘All right, Sammy, let’s talk seriously for a moment.</span>
<a name="l11441"><span class="ln">11441 </span></a><span class="s0">The cop nods, the lightness gone from his smile.</span>
<a name="l11442"><span class="ln">11442 </span></a><span class="s0">A lot of trouble.</span>
<a name="l11443"><span class="ln">11443 </span></a><span class="s0">You sort yourself out, hey?</span>
<a name="l11444"><span class="ln">11444 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s a lie, the nod.</span>
<a name="l11445"><span class="ln">11445 </span></a><span class="s0">The cop wouldn’t understand.</span>
<a name="l11446"><span class="ln">11446 </span></a><span class="s0">If kids hurt Avery, then what else can Sammy do?</span>
<a name="l11447"><span class="ln">11447 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to hit them.</span>
<a name="l11448"><span class="ln">11448 </span></a><span class="s0">He had to.</span>
<a name="l11449"><span class="ln">11449 </span></a><span class="s0">But he’s not like his dad.</span>
<a name="l11450"><span class="ln">11450 </span></a><span class="s0">He’d never never go too far.</span>
<a name="l11451"><span class="ln">11451 </span></a><span class="s0">The police leave.</span>
<a name="l11452"><span class="ln">11452 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen locks the door and marches into the kitchen.</span>
<a name="l11453"><span class="ln">11453 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ve had enough of this, Avery.</span>
<a name="l11454"><span class="ln">11454 </span></a><span class="s0">You know better.</span>
<a name="l11455"><span class="ln">11455 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy shoves between them, all fire flares and burning blood.</span>
<a name="l11456"><span class="ln">11456 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy matches Aunt Karen’s eyes, flint for charcoal.</span>
<a name="l11457"><span class="ln">11457 </span></a><span class="s0">Her teeth clench.</span>
<a name="l11458"><span class="ln">11458 </span></a><span class="s0">‘If you think he’ll learn from it, you’re wrong.</span>
<a name="l11459"><span class="ln">11459 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy seals his lips tight.</span>
<a name="l11460"><span class="ln">11460 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks at Avery.</span>
<a name="l11461"><span class="ln">11461 </span></a><span class="s0">But Avery doesn’t scream for Aunt Karen to stop.</span>
<a name="l11462"><span class="ln">11462 </span></a><span class="s0">He just looks confused and scared.</span>
<a name="l11463"><span class="ln">11463 </span></a><span class="s0">No one saves Sammy.</span>
<a name="l11464"><span class="ln">11464 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s OK, right?</span>
<a name="l11465"><span class="ln">11465 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s used to it.</span>
<a name="l11466"><span class="ln">11466 </span></a><span class="s0">So long as his brother is safe.</span>
<a name="l11467"><span class="ln">11467 </span></a><span class="s0">He licks his thumb and flips the page.</span>
<a name="l11468"><span class="ln">11468 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not been in here the entire three days, obviously.</span>
<a name="l11469"><span class="ln">11469 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he cased out a few houses.</span>
<a name="l11470"><span class="ln">11470 </span></a><span class="s0">He just hasn’t … moved … into … them yet.</span>
<a name="l11471"><span class="ln">11471 </span></a><span class="s0">Leftovers, for instance.</span>
<a name="l11472"><span class="ln">11472 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy’s Greek zucchini and halloumi falafel is incredible.</span>
<a name="l11473"><span class="ln">11473 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie’s reheated spring rolls are disgusting.</span>
<a name="l11474"><span class="ln">11474 </span></a><span class="s0">The only worry that gnaws at his chest is Avery.</span>
<a name="l11475"><span class="ln">11475 </span></a><span class="s0">Always, always Avery.</span>
<a name="l11476"><span class="ln">11476 </span></a><span class="s0">He hasn’t seen him in three days.</span>
<a name="l11477"><span class="ln">11477 </span></a><span class="s0">But he’ll be with his friends.</span>
<a name="l11478"><span class="ln">11478 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam licks his thumb and flips another page.</span>
<a name="l11479"><span class="ln">11479 </span></a><span class="s0">He feels so guilty.</span>
<a name="l11480"><span class="ln">11480 </span></a><span class="s0">To bathe in?</span>
<a name="l11481"><span class="ln">11481 </span></a><span class="s0">‘TRY ME.’ A small smile tugs at Sam’s lips.</span>
<a name="l11482"><span class="ln">11482 </span></a><span class="s0">Dust lines the bookshelves.</span>
<a name="l11483"><span class="ln">11483 </span></a><span class="s0">He wonders what happened to the De Laineys’ mother.</span>
<a name="l11484"><span class="ln">11484 </span></a><span class="s0">Did she walk out too?</span>
<a name="l11485"><span class="ln">11485 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam can’t remember his mother’s face.</span>
<a name="l11486"><span class="ln">11486 </span></a><span class="s0">Leaving them with him.</span>
<a name="l11487"><span class="ln">11487 </span></a><span class="s0">Their dad and his fists and his molasses eyes.</span>
<a name="l11488"><span class="ln">11488 </span></a><span class="s0">She’s just another reason to never, never trust adults.</span>
<a name="l11489"><span class="ln">11489 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam drops the book.</span>
<a name="l11490"><span class="ln">11490 </span></a><span class="s0">But he doesn’t have time.</span>
<a name="l11491"><span class="ln">11491 </span></a><span class="s0">‘… because it’s illegal for kids to use glitter, actually.</span>
<a name="l11492"><span class="ln">11492 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I am twenty-five!’ Toby shouts.</span>
<a name="l11493"><span class="ln">11493 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Nice try,’ Moxie says and turns.</span>
<a name="l11494"><span class="ln">11494 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t call the police yet.</span>
<a name="l11495"><span class="ln">11495 </span></a><span class="s0">I can explain.</span>
<a name="l11496"><span class="ln">11496 </span></a><span class="s0">Except he really really can’t.</span>
<a name="l11497"><span class="ln">11497 </span></a><span class="s0">Their eyes meet.</span>
<a name="l11498"><span class="ln">11498 </span></a><span class="s0">Air escapes Sam’s lungs like they’ve been punctured.</span>
<a name="l11499"><span class="ln">11499 </span></a><span class="s0">Toby stands behind her wearing a Batman mask.</span>
<a name="l11500"><span class="ln">11500 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Who’s dat?’ Moxie screams.</span>
<a name="l11501"><span class="ln">11501 </span></a><span class="s0">She hurls the ice cream tub at Sam.</span>
<a name="l11502"><span class="ln">11502 </span></a><span class="s0">The lid pops.</span>
<a name="l11503"><span class="ln">11503 </span></a><span class="s0">The air fills with a soaring, shimmering rainbow arc.</span>
<a name="l11504"><span class="ln">11504 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie keeps screaming.</span>
<a name="l11505"><span class="ln">11505 </span></a><span class="s0">Toby joins in.</span>
<a name="l11506"><span class="ln">11506 </span></a><span class="s0">He jumps the veranda steps and his shoes hit cement.</span>
<a name="l11507"><span class="ln">11507 </span></a><span class="s0">Get out of here and don’t ever look back.</span>
<a name="l11508"><span class="ln">11508 </span></a><span class="s0">Asking himself why why why did he do this?</span>
<a name="l11509"><span class="ln">11509 </span></a><span class="s0">He didn’t want it to end like this.</span>
<a name="l11510"><span class="ln">11510 </span></a><span class="s0">It rakes his throat.</span>
<a name="l11511"><span class="ln">11511 </span></a><span class="s0">Get away from here.</span>
<a name="l11512"><span class="ln">11512 </span></a><span class="s0">He listens for sirens.</span>
<a name="l11513"><span class="ln">11513 </span></a><span class="s0">For someone to shout stop that thief.</span>
<a name="l11514"><span class="ln">11514 </span></a><span class="s0">Walk, Sammy, just keep walking.</span>
<a name="l11515"><span class="ln">11515 </span></a><span class="s0">Anywhere but here.</span>
<a name="l11516"><span class="ln">11516 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t want to be here.</span>
<a name="l11517"><span class="ln">11517 </span></a><span class="s0">There are simple rules for surviving a lifestyle like his.</span>
<a name="l11518"><span class="ln">11518 </span></a><span class="s0">Number one: don’t get caught.</span>
<a name="l11519"><span class="ln">11519 </span></a><span class="s0">And he freaking blew that.</span>
<a name="l11520"><span class="ln">11520 </span></a><span class="s0">It makes him angry, all over again.</span>
<a name="l11521"><span class="ln">11521 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen’s street wasn’t much better.</span>
<a name="l11522"><span class="ln">11522 </span></a><span class="s0">And Avery’s just trotted right back in.</span>
<a name="l11523"><span class="ln">11523 </span></a><span class="s0">Because it’s familiar.</span>
<a name="l11524"><span class="ln">11524 </span></a><span class="s0">Because it’s home.</span>
<a name="l11525"><span class="ln">11525 </span></a><span class="s0">Yeah OK, the Lou brothers are still criminals.</span>
<a name="l11526"><span class="ln">11526 </span></a><span class="s0">Endless plans as they walked to and from school.</span>
<a name="l11527"><span class="ln">11527 </span></a><span class="s0">All they need is money, right?</span>
<a name="l11528"><span class="ln">11528 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s not impossible.</span>
<a name="l11529"><span class="ln">11529 </span></a><span class="s0">He stops outside a row of apartments.</span>
<a name="l11530"><span class="ln">11530 </span></a><span class="s0">Windows are barred.</span>
<a name="l11531"><span class="ln">11531 </span></a><span class="s0">Piles of junk sit in gutters.</span>
<a name="l11532"><span class="ln">11532 </span></a><span class="s0">Is this even the right number?</span>
<a name="l11533"><span class="ln">11533 </span></a><span class="s0">Does he know anyone who doesn’t want him in jail?</span>
<a name="l11534"><span class="ln">11534 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs new friends.</span>
<a name="l11535"><span class="ln">11535 </span></a><span class="s0">Or any friends.</span>
<a name="l11536"><span class="ln">11536 </span></a><span class="s0">A non-judgemental dog maybe.</span>
<a name="l11537"><span class="ln">11537 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What is my life?’ he mutters and knocks.</span>
<a name="l11538"><span class="ln">11538 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Is Avery Lou there?</span>
<a name="l11539"><span class="ln">11539 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m his brother.’ Silence.</span>
<a name="l11540"><span class="ln">11540 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam kicks the door.</span>
<a name="l11541"><span class="ln">11541 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Wow, it is you,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l11542"><span class="ln">11542 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I thought you hated this place.’ He pauses.</span>
<a name="l11543"><span class="ln">11543 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And me.’ Sam grits his teeth.</span>
<a name="l11544"><span class="ln">11544 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You know that’s not true.</span>
<a name="l11545"><span class="ln">11545 </span></a><span class="s0">Now can I come in?</span>
<a name="l11546"><span class="ln">11546 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m about to be arrested.’ Avery opens the door.</span>
<a name="l11547"><span class="ln">11547 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I guess that’s usual.</span>
<a name="l11548"><span class="ln">11548 </span></a><span class="s0">But I—’ He breaks off with a choke.</span>
<a name="l11549"><span class="ln">11549 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam shoves past, leaving glittering footprints.</span>
<a name="l11550"><span class="ln">11550 </span></a><span class="s0">Honestly, it wouldn’t be that hard to catch him.</span>
<a name="l11551"><span class="ln">11551 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery opens his mouth.</span>
<a name="l11552"><span class="ln">11552 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Just lend me some clothes and—’ Avery bursts out laughing.</span>
<a name="l11553"><span class="ln">11553 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s too much.</span>
<a name="l11554"><span class="ln">11554 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery makes a show of holding his breath.</span>
<a name="l11555"><span class="ln">11555 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam is done.</span>
<a name="l11556"><span class="ln">11556 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s just done.</span>
<a name="l11557"><span class="ln">11557 </span></a><span class="s0">And his brother is a jerk.</span>
<a name="l11558"><span class="ln">11558 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Screw you, Avery,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l11559"><span class="ln">11559 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks so much younger when he’s laughing.</span>
<a name="l11560"><span class="ln">11560 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam hopes he hacks up a lung.</span>
<a name="l11561"><span class="ln">11561 </span></a><span class="s0">The carpet smells like cat piss.</span>
<a name="l11562"><span class="ln">11562 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam rubs the bridge of his nose.</span>
<a name="l11563"><span class="ln">11563 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s a mistake.</span>
<a name="l11564"><span class="ln">11564 </span></a><span class="s0">A creep hiding in her house.</span>
<a name="l11565"><span class="ln">11565 </span></a><span class="s0">Hot, anxious knives carve his stomach.</span>
<a name="l11566"><span class="ln">11566 </span></a><span class="s0">‘So what happened?</span>
<a name="l11567"><span class="ln">11567 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hilarious,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l11568"><span class="ln">11568 </span></a><span class="s0">Crumbs fall out of the folds.</span>
<a name="l11569"><span class="ln">11569 </span></a><span class="s0">Day off.’ But he has too many lying tells.</span>
<a name="l11570"><span class="ln">11570 </span></a><span class="s0">Like how he immediately hunches over, waiting for a blow.</span>
<a name="l11571"><span class="ln">11571 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Shower’s upstairs,’ he says, fast.</span>
<a name="l11572"><span class="ln">11572 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam sighs and follows him upstairs.</span>
<a name="l11573"><span class="ln">11573 </span></a><span class="s0">There are other closed doors, muted voices behind them.</span>
<a name="l11574"><span class="ln">11574 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Um, I don’t know?</span>
<a name="l11575"><span class="ln">11575 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Because I have friends.</span>
<a name="l11576"><span class="ln">11576 </span></a><span class="s0">What exactly is he saying?</span>
<a name="l11577"><span class="ln">11577 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But they’re all way older than you.’ They’re using you.</span>
<a name="l11578"><span class="ln">11578 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re bad news.</span>
<a name="l11579"><span class="ln">11579 </span></a><span class="s0">Are you a getaway driver?</span>
<a name="l11580"><span class="ln">11580 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy does not have the energy for that conversation.</span>
<a name="l11581"><span class="ln">11581 </span></a><span class="s0">About what?’ Avery’s face is so open – so naive.</span>
<a name="l11582"><span class="ln">11582 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam scratches glitter behind his ear.</span>
<a name="l11583"><span class="ln">11583 </span></a><span class="s0">Just do it later.</span>
<a name="l11584"><span class="ln">11584 </span></a><span class="s0">‘About why you’re covered in glitter?’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l11585"><span class="ln">11585 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Never mind,’ says Sam.</span>
<a name="l11586"><span class="ln">11586 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It won’t happen again.’ It will never, never happen again.</span>
<a name="l11587"><span class="ln">11587 </span></a><span class="s0">Just not glitter.</span>
<a name="l11588"><span class="ln">11588 </span></a><span class="s0">He gives up.</span>
<a name="l11589"><span class="ln">11589 </span></a><span class="s0">Why couldn’t Moxie have just slapped him?</span>
<a name="l11590"><span class="ln">11590 </span></a><span class="s0">He needed that fragile paradise.</span>
<a name="l11591"><span class="ln">11591 </span></a><span class="s0">He needed it so he could breathe again.</span>
<a name="l11592"><span class="ln">11592 </span></a><span class="s0">He hesitates over his glitter-covered clothes – De Lainey clothes.</span>
<a name="l11593"><span class="ln">11593 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he stuffs them into a garbage bag.</span>
<a name="l11594"><span class="ln">11594 </span></a><span class="s0">Forget it, Sam.</span>
<a name="l11595"><span class="ln">11595 </span></a><span class="s0">And he’s not alone.</span>
<a name="l11596"><span class="ln">11596 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re both drinking beer.</span>
<a name="l11597"><span class="ln">11597 </span></a><span class="s0">The girl looks him up and down coolly.</span>
<a name="l11598"><span class="ln">11598 </span></a><span class="s0">Once upon a time, it was little cars.</span>
<a name="l11599"><span class="ln">11599 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam tucks his hands into his jean pockets.</span>
<a name="l11600"><span class="ln">11600 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Um, hi … Vin.</span>
<a name="l11601"><span class="ln">11601 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh,’ Avery says, ‘you still look like roadkill.</span>
<a name="l11602"><span class="ln">11602 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam jerks his shirt back down.</span>
<a name="l11603"><span class="ln">11603 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s not why— Is it?</span>
<a name="l11604"><span class="ln">11604 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Avery,’ Sam tries again, voice quiet, ‘can we go?</span>
<a name="l11605"><span class="ln">11605 </span></a><span class="s0">Let’s—’ ‘I’ll take him over,’ Vin says.</span>
<a name="l11606"><span class="ln">11606 </span></a><span class="s0">It freaks him out, what happens when he’s not here.</span>
<a name="l11607"><span class="ln">11607 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam didn’t imagine it’d go this far.</span>
<a name="l11608"><span class="ln">11608 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Be nice,’ Avery whispers.</span>
<a name="l11609"><span class="ln">11609 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam is nice.</span>
<a name="l11610"><span class="ln">11610 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s obviously fixing it up for Vin.</span>
<a name="l11611"><span class="ln">11611 </span></a><span class="s0">Is that why she likes him?</span>
<a name="l11612"><span class="ln">11612 </span></a><span class="s0">The place is open.</span>
<a name="l11613"><span class="ln">11613 </span></a><span class="s0">An unfamiliar man talks with a customer over a car.</span>
<a name="l11614"><span class="ln">11614 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s chest aches.</span>
<a name="l11615"><span class="ln">11615 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam is nice instead of punching Vin in the throat.</span>
<a name="l11616"><span class="ln">11616 </span></a><span class="s0">He knows he’s being unreasonable.</span>
<a name="l11617"><span class="ln">11617 </span></a><span class="s0">The girl is just being decent.</span>
<a name="l11618"><span class="ln">11618 </span></a><span class="s0">No one seems angry.</span>
<a name="l11619"><span class="ln">11619 </span></a><span class="s0">She might think the backpack is full of coins, right?</span>
<a name="l11620"><span class="ln">11620 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s a thief.</span>
<a name="l11621"><span class="ln">11621 </span></a><span class="s0">Coins are logical.</span>
<a name="l11622"><span class="ln">11622 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam scrambles for his seatbelt.</span>
<a name="l11623"><span class="ln">11623 </span></a><span class="s0">She circuits them and pauses by the water edge.</span>
<a name="l11624"><span class="ln">11624 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey!’ Sam’s voice echoes, too shrill.</span>
<a name="l11625"><span class="ln">11625 </span></a><span class="s0">He springs forward.</span>
<a name="l11626"><span class="ln">11626 </span></a><span class="s0">The cry that escapes Sam’s lips is hardly human.</span>
<a name="l11627"><span class="ln">11627 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m letting you go now.</span>
<a name="l11628"><span class="ln">11628 </span></a><span class="s0">His cheeks are wet.</span>
<a name="l11629"><span class="ln">11629 </span></a><span class="s0">His backpack is gone.</span>
<a name="l11630"><span class="ln">11630 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He told me about your crazy habit.’ He told.</span>
<a name="l11631"><span class="ln">11631 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t even understand when he shouldn’t.</span>
<a name="l11632"><span class="ln">11632 </span></a><span class="s0">But how long has he known about the keys?</span>
<a name="l11633"><span class="ln">11633 </span></a><span class="s0">I need a kid like you.</span>
<a name="l11634"><span class="ln">11634 </span></a><span class="s0">A good lock pick.</span>
<a name="l11635"><span class="ln">11635 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But you need to shed the baby face.</span>
<a name="l11636"><span class="ln">11636 </span></a><span class="s0">I mean look at you, kid.</span>
<a name="l11637"><span class="ln">11637 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re crying over a backpack.</span>
<a name="l11638"><span class="ln">11638 </span></a><span class="s0">He couldn’t even explain it to Avery.</span>
<a name="l11639"><span class="ln">11639 </span></a><span class="s0">The keys were promises.</span>
<a name="l11640"><span class="ln">11640 </span></a><span class="s0">They were all he had.</span>
<a name="l11641"><span class="ln">11641 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t struggle.</span>
<a name="l11642"><span class="ln">11642 </span></a><span class="s0">But his arms hang loose at his sides.</span>
<a name="l11643"><span class="ln">11643 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery knew Vin was going to do this.</span>
<a name="l11644"><span class="ln">11644 </span></a><span class="s0">Drugs?’ Vin gives a laugh and slides on aviator sunglasses.</span>
<a name="l11645"><span class="ln">11645 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I know you’re only a kid, so come on.</span>
<a name="l11646"><span class="ln">11646 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll buy you some chips on the way back.</span>
<a name="l11647"><span class="ln">11647 </span></a><span class="s0">Except he doesn’t want to die.</span>
<a name="l11648"><span class="ln">11648 </span></a><span class="s0">We gut houses like you do.</span>
<a name="l11649"><span class="ln">11649 </span></a><span class="s0">They have no idea.</span>
<a name="l11650"><span class="ln">11650 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s not about the stealing from houses.</span>
<a name="l11651"><span class="ln">11651 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s about stealing the houses.</span>
<a name="l11652"><span class="ln">11652 </span></a><span class="s0">Right now, his lungs are rust.</span>
<a name="l11653"><span class="ln">11653 </span></a><span class="s0">He follows Vin.</span>
<a name="l11654"><span class="ln">11654 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery drops down on the sofa where Sam’s sprawled.</span>
<a name="l11655"><span class="ln">11655 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery pokes the back of his neck.</span>
<a name="l11656"><span class="ln">11656 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam doesn’t react.</span>
<a name="l11657"><span class="ln">11657 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I looked at them when you slept.</span>
<a name="l11658"><span class="ln">11658 </span></a><span class="s0">All the time.</span>
<a name="l11659"><span class="ln">11659 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But Vin says—’ Sam flips channels faster.</span>
<a name="l11660"><span class="ln">11660 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Still glittery.’ ‘Surprise,’ Sam says, flat.</span>
<a name="l11661"><span class="ln">11661 </span></a><span class="s0">Isn’t it painfully obvious?</span>
<a name="l11662"><span class="ln">11662 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery chews his thumbnail, eyes on the TV.</span>
<a name="l11663"><span class="ln">11663 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can take care of myself.’ That’s a hilarious joke.</span>
<a name="l11664"><span class="ln">11664 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You didn’t tell me how you got caught,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l11665"><span class="ln">11665 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery looks worried and Sam’s story trails off.</span>
<a name="l11666"><span class="ln">11666 </span></a><span class="s0">It doesn’t matter anyway.</span>
<a name="l11667"><span class="ln">11667 </span></a><span class="s0">There are things with sharper edges to unpack.</span>
<a name="l11668"><span class="ln">11668 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s still isn’t sure how old she is.</span>
<a name="l11669"><span class="ln">11669 </span></a><span class="s0">And it always seems like a rehearsed act.</span>
<a name="l11670"><span class="ln">11670 </span></a><span class="s0">She dumps the greasy paper bag on the coffee table.</span>
<a name="l11671"><span class="ln">11671 </span></a><span class="s0">Then she kisses Avery on the mouth.</span>
<a name="l11672"><span class="ln">11672 </span></a><span class="s0">She kisses a lot of different people, Sam’s noticed.</span>
<a name="l11673"><span class="ln">11673 </span></a><span class="s0">But talking about kissing and sex is too awkward, OK?</span>
<a name="l11674"><span class="ln">11674 </span></a><span class="s0">It shouldn’t be Sam’s job.</span>
<a name="l11675"><span class="ln">11675 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s only fifteen.</span>
<a name="l11676"><span class="ln">11676 </span></a><span class="s0">Except it always is his job.</span>
<a name="l11677"><span class="ln">11677 </span></a><span class="s0">She flops in a sofa and unwraps hers.</span>
<a name="l11678"><span class="ln">11678 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin hasn’t figured it out?</span>
<a name="l11679"><span class="ln">11679 </span></a><span class="s0">Or is this another thing she’s fixing?</span>
<a name="l11680"><span class="ln">11680 </span></a><span class="s0">Eat your food mixed.</span>
<a name="l11681"><span class="ln">11681 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam entirely hates Vin.</span>
<a name="l11682"><span class="ln">11682 </span></a><span class="s0">Why is Avery putting up with it though?</span>
<a name="l11683"><span class="ln">11683 </span></a><span class="s0">Because he likes her?</span>
<a name="l11684"><span class="ln">11684 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam feels sick.</span>
<a name="l11685"><span class="ln">11685 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin licks juice off her thumb.</span>
<a name="l11686"><span class="ln">11686 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How old are you anyway, Sammy?</span>
<a name="l11687"><span class="ln">11687 </span></a><span class="s0">Fourteen?’ Sam frowns.</span>
<a name="l11688"><span class="ln">11688 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t want to do stuff like that.</span>
<a name="l11689"><span class="ln">11689 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin’s eyes narrow.</span>
<a name="l11690"><span class="ln">11690 </span></a><span class="s0">She gets her teeth whitened to prove it.</span>
<a name="l11691"><span class="ln">11691 </span></a><span class="s0">A muscle twitches in Sam’s jaw.</span>
<a name="l11692"><span class="ln">11692 </span></a><span class="s0">All of it.</span>
<a name="l11693"><span class="ln">11693 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam springs towards it, tripping over boxes of stacked junk.</span>
<a name="l11694"><span class="ln">11694 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s up hard against the wall.</span>
<a name="l11695"><span class="ln">11695 </span></a><span class="s0">Her eyes are bottomless and frigid.</span>
<a name="l11696"><span class="ln">11696 </span></a><span class="s0">‘—don’t disagree with me,’ Vin is saying.</span>
<a name="l11697"><span class="ln">11697 </span></a><span class="s0">That kid can fit.’ ‘I said n-no.’ Avery’s voice shakes.</span>
<a name="l11698"><span class="ln">11698 </span></a><span class="s0">His voice takes on a desperate edge.</span>
<a name="l11699"><span class="ln">11699 </span></a><span class="s0">He springs into the kitchen and shoves Vin off.</span>
<a name="l11700"><span class="ln">11700 </span></a><span class="s0">Cutlery slips and clatters to the floor.</span>
<a name="l11701"><span class="ln">11701 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood sprays hot over Sam’s fingers.</span>
<a name="l11702"><span class="ln">11702 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery gives a startled yell and grabs Sam’s waist.</span>
<a name="l11703"><span class="ln">11703 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sammy, don’t—’ But fire blazes in Sam’s lungs.</span>
<a name="l11704"><span class="ln">11704 </span></a><span class="s0">Every time he explodes.</span>
<a name="l11705"><span class="ln">11705 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood soaks her shirt.</span>
<a name="l11706"><span class="ln">11706 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t don’t.’ His voice cracks.</span>
<a name="l11707"><span class="ln">11707 </span></a><span class="s0">‘D-don’t hit people.</span>
<a name="l11708"><span class="ln">11708 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t feel anything.</span>
<a name="l11709"><span class="ln">11709 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s spun out of invincible clouds.</span>
<a name="l11710"><span class="ln">11710 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin raises bloody fingers towards the door.</span>
<a name="l11711"><span class="ln">11711 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Get out.’ Sam’s anger is cooling, leaving his hands shaking.</span>
<a name="l11712"><span class="ln">11712 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Fine.’ His voice feels far away.</span>
<a name="l11713"><span class="ln">11713 </span></a><span class="s0">Tries to grab his wrist.</span>
<a name="l11714"><span class="ln">11714 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery jerks back.</span>
<a name="l11715"><span class="ln">11715 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin’s voice explodes.</span>
<a name="l11716"><span class="ln">11716 </span></a><span class="s0">A door slams upstairs.</span>
<a name="l11717"><span class="ln">11717 </span></a><span class="s0">How could he scare his brother?</span>
<a name="l11718"><span class="ln">11718 </span></a><span class="s0">He trips on the threshold.</span>
<a name="l11719"><span class="ln">11719 </span></a><span class="s0">Then she hurls him out and slams the door.</span>
<a name="l11720"><span class="ln">11720 </span></a><span class="s0">He waits an hour.</span>
<a name="l11721"><span class="ln">11721 </span></a><span class="s0">The lock comes apart under Sam’s thin, light fingers.</span>
<a name="l11722"><span class="ln">11722 </span></a><span class="s0">Except right now, Avery doesn’t want to be around him.</span>
<a name="l11723"><span class="ln">11723 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam scared his brother.</span>
<a name="l11724"><span class="ln">11724 </span></a><span class="s0">He scared his brother.</span>
<a name="l11725"><span class="ln">11725 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to stop doing this, losing it.</span>
<a name="l11726"><span class="ln">11726 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s nothing to take except handfuls of cobwebs.</span>
<a name="l11727"><span class="ln">11727 </span></a><span class="s0">Close your eyes and pretend this is a bed.</span>

<a name="l11776"><span class="ln">11776 </span></a><span class="s0">Like maybe he can make himself look younger, innocent, sorry.</span>
<a name="l11777"><span class="ln">11777 </span></a><span class="s0">What should he say?</span>

<a name="l11796"><span class="ln">11796 </span></a><span class="s0">She won’t budge for that either.</span>
<a name="l11797"><span class="ln">11797 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sorry is not enough,’ Aunt Karen says, vicious.</span>
<a name="l11798"><span class="ln">11798 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But can I just have one night?</span>
<a name="l11799"><span class="ln">11799 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam looks desperately at her back, needing her to understand.</span>
<a name="l11800"><span class="ln">11800 </span></a><span class="s0">Truly stop and see him.</span>
<a name="l11801"><span class="ln">11801 </span></a><span class="s0">He runs after her, heart falling through his chest.</span>
<a name="l11802"><span class="ln">11802 </span></a><span class="s0">Her hand shoots up and cracks across his face.</span>
<a name="l11803"><span class="ln">11803 </span></a><span class="s0">It takes a moment for the sting to catch up.</span>
<a name="l11804"><span class="ln">11804 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam stares, his mouth open, red fingerprints across his cheekbone.</span>
<a name="l11805"><span class="ln">11805 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I was protecting him,’ Sam whispers.</span>
<a name="l11806"><span class="ln">11806 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You like the power you get from hurting people.</span>
<a name="l11807"><span class="ln">11807 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re just like your father.’ Sam can’t speak.</span>
<a name="l11808"><span class="ln">11808 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s not him.</span>
<a name="l11809"><span class="ln">11809 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s never him.</span>
<a name="l11810"><span class="ln">11810 </span></a><span class="s0">Trying to keep himself here.</span>
<a name="l11811"><span class="ln">11811 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t talk about Avery like that,’ he whispers.</span>
<a name="l11812"><span class="ln">11812 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like she doesn’t hear him.</span>
<a name="l11813"><span class="ln">11813 </span></a><span class="s0">Aunt Karen says, voice suddenly crisp.</span>

<a name="l11818"><span class="ln">11818 </span></a><span class="s0">Does he deserve it?</span>
<a name="l11819"><span class="ln">11819 </span></a><span class="s0">you do you do you do you do He turns.</span>
<a name="l11820"><span class="ln">11820 </span></a><span class="s0">He walks away.</span>
<a name="l11821"><span class="ln">11821 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I thought so,’ Aunt Karen calls.</span>
<a name="l11822"><span class="ln">11822 </span></a><span class="s0">Her shoulders stay stiff.</span>
<a name="l11823"><span class="ln">11823 </span></a><span class="s0">Her face sets.</span>
<a name="l11824"><span class="ln">11824 </span></a><span class="s0">Or broken bones.</span>
<a name="l11825"><span class="ln">11825 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s having a rough life.</span>
<a name="l11826"><span class="ln">11826 </span></a><span class="s0">High school sucks.</span>
<a name="l11827"><span class="ln">11827 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s aware of how different he is now.</span>
<a name="l11828"><span class="ln">11828 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s stupid, wanting friends.</span>
<a name="l11829"><span class="ln">11829 </span></a><span class="s0">But Sammy understands.</span>
<a name="l11830"><span class="ln">11830 </span></a><span class="s0">He wouldn’t mind a friend.</span>
<a name="l11831"><span class="ln">11831 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s worried school will kill Avery.</span>
<a name="l11832"><span class="ln">11832 </span></a><span class="s0">But he can fix this, right?</span>
<a name="l11833"><span class="ln">11833 </span></a><span class="s0">He fixes everything.</span>
<a name="l11834"><span class="ln">11834 </span></a><span class="s0">He scales it like Spiderman.</span>
<a name="l11835"><span class="ln">11835 </span></a><span class="s0">Hand over hand, propelled by momentum and sheer will.</span>
<a name="l11836"><span class="ln">11836 </span></a><span class="s0">But he’s up.</span>
<a name="l11837"><span class="ln">11837 </span></a><span class="s0">A happy shout.</span>
<a name="l11838"><span class="ln">11838 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery pulls his hood off.</span>
<a name="l11839"><span class="ln">11839 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll catch the moon and steal it.</span>

<a name="l11842"><span class="ln">11842 </span></a><span class="s0">But it’s fine.</span>
<a name="l11843"><span class="ln">11843 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s just happy.</span>
<a name="l11844"><span class="ln">11844 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy can breathe again.</span>
<a name="l11845"><span class="ln">11845 </span></a><span class="s0">And it’s good.</span>
<a name="l11846"><span class="ln">11846 </span></a><span class="s0">Everything is good.</span>
<a name="l11847"><span class="ln">11847 </span></a><span class="s0">He jumps again and again.</span>
<a name="l11848"><span class="ln">11848 </span></a><span class="s0">And he can take what he wants.</span>

<a name="l11859"><span class="ln">11859 </span></a><span class="s0">But so what?</span>
<a name="l11860"><span class="ln">11860 </span></a><span class="s0">He throws his arm over Avery’s shoulder.</span>
<a name="l11861"><span class="ln">11861 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re height for height right now.</span>
<a name="l11862"><span class="ln">11862 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We are the kings of nowhere,’ Sammy says.</span>
<a name="l11863"><span class="ln">11863 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We only need us.’ He’s a very good liar.</span>
<a name="l11864"><span class="ln">11864 </span></a><span class="s0">The wallet is hot and heavy in Sam’s sweat-slick hands.</span>
<a name="l11865"><span class="ln">11865 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam has a headache.</span>
<a name="l11866"><span class="ln">11866 </span></a><span class="s0">From sun beating on his bare head?</span>
<a name="l11867"><span class="ln">11867 </span></a><span class="s0">From sleeping on the ground?</span>
<a name="l11868"><span class="ln">11868 </span></a><span class="s0">Except he doesn’t want to.</span>
<a name="l11869"><span class="ln">11869 </span></a><span class="s0">He just doesn’t care any more.</span>
<a name="l11870"><span class="ln">11870 </span></a><span class="s0">Seaglass necklaces and hand-painted bowls and boxes of postcards.</span>
<a name="l11871"><span class="ln">11871 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That’s ten for two, boy,’ the old woman says.</span>

<a name="l11873"><span class="ln">11873 </span></a><span class="s0">But they’re making him sick.</span>
<a name="l11874"><span class="ln">11874 </span></a><span class="s0">‘This OK?’ he says.</span>
<a name="l11875"><span class="ln">11875 </span></a><span class="s0">The first person to smile at him in days.</span>
<a name="l11876"><span class="ln">11876 </span></a><span class="s0">When is he going to understand that it’s over?</span>
<a name="l11877"><span class="ln">11877 </span></a><span class="s0">She slammed the door in his face.</span>
<a name="l11878"><span class="ln">11878 </span></a><span class="s0">What’s it going to take for him to stop?</span>
<a name="l11879"><span class="ln">11879 </span></a><span class="s0">The police to show up?</span>
<a name="l11880"><span class="ln">11880 </span></a><span class="s0">He should turn a few days into for ever days.</span>
<a name="l11881"><span class="ln">11881 </span></a><span class="s0">Do everyone a favour.</span>
<a name="l11882"><span class="ln">11882 </span></a><span class="s0">Come on, cut the self-loathing.</span>
<a name="l11883"><span class="ln">11883 </span></a><span class="s0">The scrolls of material fit nicely in two hands.</span>

<a name="l11891"><span class="ln">11891 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Because you, um, s-sew,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l11892"><span class="ln">11892 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Were you actually living upstairs like a creepy psycho?</span>
<a name="l11893"><span class="ln">11893 </span></a><span class="s0">Like … why?</span>
<a name="l11894"><span class="ln">11894 </span></a><span class="s0">I had nowhere to go, he wants to say.</span>

<a name="l11910"><span class="ln">11910 </span></a><span class="s0">This is all wrong.</span>
<a name="l11911"><span class="ln">11911 </span></a><span class="s0">The sympathetic look in her eyes startles him.</span>
<a name="l11912"><span class="ln">11912 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How mad are we talking?’ the florist says.</span>
<a name="l11913"><span class="ln">11913 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Because flowers send a message, you know.</span>
<a name="l11914"><span class="ln">11914 </span></a><span class="s0">He should’ve lifted another wallet.</span>
<a name="l11915"><span class="ln">11915 </span></a><span class="s0">Destroying more than fixing.</span>
<a name="l11916"><span class="ln">11916 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam left alone.</span>
<a name="l11917"><span class="ln">11917 </span></a><span class="s0">Yeah, OK, stop.</span>
<a name="l11918"><span class="ln">11918 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well.’ Sam shakes the hair out of his eyes.</span>
<a name="l11919"><span class="ln">11919 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Which I’m not,’ Sam adds, quickly, looking up.</span>
<a name="l11920"><span class="ln">11920 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m not a creeper.</span>
<a name="l11921"><span class="ln">11921 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ouch.’ The florist taps her manicured fingernails on the countertop.</span>
<a name="l11922"><span class="ln">11922 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I just want to say sorry.</span>
<a name="l11923"><span class="ln">11923 </span></a><span class="s0">I don’t …’ He swallows.</span>
<a name="l11924"><span class="ln">11924 </span></a><span class="s0">She folds her arms, surveying them.</span>
<a name="l11925"><span class="ln">11925 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam trails after her.</span>
<a name="l11926"><span class="ln">11926 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Chivalry is not dead!</span>
<a name="l11927"><span class="ln">11927 </span></a><span class="s0">And you’re kind of adorable.</span>
<a name="l11928"><span class="ln">11928 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Follow.’ He does.</span>
<a name="l11929"><span class="ln">11929 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I only have five dollars,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l11930"><span class="ln">11930 </span></a><span class="s0">The florist smiles.</span>
<a name="l11931"><span class="ln">11931 </span></a><span class="s0">He tried to take the florist’s advice.</span>
<a name="l11932"><span class="ln">11932 </span></a><span class="s0">He really tried.</span>
<a name="l11933"><span class="ln">11933 </span></a><span class="s0">But at least his tangles have been tamed?</span>
<a name="l11934"><span class="ln">11934 </span></a><span class="s0">And … a lot of glitter resurfaced.</span>
<a name="l11935"><span class="ln">11935 </span></a><span class="s0">Consequently he has the worst sunburn over his pale shoulders.</span>
<a name="l11936"><span class="ln">11936 </span></a><span class="s0">But he did an OK job, right?</span>
<a name="l11937"><span class="ln">11937 </span></a><span class="s0">That will not help.</span>
<a name="l11938"><span class="ln">11938 </span></a><span class="s0">Deep in the house, a baby wails.</span>
<a name="l11939"><span class="ln">11939 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe she didn’t hear?</span>
<a name="l11940"><span class="ln">11940 </span></a><span class="s0">Her frown intensifies.</span>
<a name="l11941"><span class="ln">11941 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l11942"><span class="ln">11942 </span></a><span class="s0">Possibly proof his intentions are honourable.</span>
<a name="l11943"><span class="ln">11943 </span></a><span class="s0">Possibly a shield.</span>
<a name="l11944"><span class="ln">11944 </span></a><span class="s0">Stand up straight.</span>
<a name="l11945"><span class="ln">11945 </span></a><span class="s0">Look her in the eye.</span>
<a name="l11946"><span class="ln">11946 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t lose it.</span>
<a name="l11947"><span class="ln">11947 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I just want to say sorry,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l11948"><span class="ln">11948 </span></a><span class="s0">Which is exactly what he is.</span>
<a name="l11949"><span class="ln">11949 </span></a><span class="s0">He falls off with a shriek of laughter.</span>
<a name="l11950"><span class="ln">11950 </span></a><span class="s0">She hasn’t slammed the door.</span>
<a name="l11951"><span class="ln">11951 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s maybe got five seconds.</span>
<a name="l11952"><span class="ln">11952 </span></a><span class="s0">‘When you were away.</span>
<a name="l11953"><span class="ln">11953 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You all thought I was someone else’s friend.</span>
<a name="l11954"><span class="ln">11954 </span></a><span class="s0">So I stayed.</span>
<a name="l11955"><span class="ln">11955 </span></a><span class="s0">I swear it was an accident.’ Moxie’s scowl remains.</span>
<a name="l11956"><span class="ln">11956 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You lost me there.’ Moxie gestures to her shirt.</span>
<a name="l11957"><span class="ln">11957 </span></a><span class="s0">Gingerly, Sam offers the box of chocolates.</span>
<a name="l11958"><span class="ln">11958 </span></a><span class="s0">She takes the box.</span>
<a name="l11959"><span class="ln">11959 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And you’re not forgiven.’ But she took the chocolates.</span>
<a name="l11960"><span class="ln">11960 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s heart dares to beat again.</span>
<a name="l11961"><span class="ln">11961 </span></a><span class="s0">She looks curious.</span>
<a name="l11962"><span class="ln">11962 </span></a><span class="s0">She plucks a chocolate and bites.</span>
<a name="l11963"><span class="ln">11963 </span></a><span class="s0">Then flush out the pool.</span>
<a name="l11964"><span class="ln">11964 </span></a><span class="s0">Then fill it.</span>
<a name="l11965"><span class="ln">11965 </span></a><span class="s0">The hose is pointing at Sam.</span>
<a name="l11966"><span class="ln">11966 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam gets a faceful of water.</span>
<a name="l11967"><span class="ln">11967 </span></a><span class="s0">Laughing is good, right?</span>
<a name="l11968"><span class="ln">11968 </span></a><span class="s0">Because it seems she’s accepted the apology.</span>
<a name="l11969"><span class="ln">11969 </span></a><span class="s0">‘So you’re homeless,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l11970"><span class="ln">11970 </span></a><span class="s0">Not like a question.</span>
<a name="l11971"><span class="ln">11971 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s caramel gets suddenly stuck in his throat.</span>
<a name="l11972"><span class="ln">11972 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Not around,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l11973"><span class="ln">11973 </span></a><span class="s0">I just – I make do.’ ‘In my house, clearly.</span>
<a name="l11974"><span class="ln">11974 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No.’ Moxie looks away again.</span>
<a name="l11975"><span class="ln">11975 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It was … it was my mum’s space.</span>
<a name="l11976"><span class="ln">11976 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s said the wrong thing.</span>
<a name="l11977"><span class="ln">11977 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No, my mum died.’ Moxie’s voice is strangely emotionless.</span>
<a name="l11978"><span class="ln">11978 </span></a><span class="s0">She … she had it after Dash was born too.</span>
<a name="l11979"><span class="ln">11979 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s why there’s like seven years between Dash and Toby.</span>
<a name="l11980"><span class="ln">11980 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie doesn’t seem fazed.</span>
<a name="l11981"><span class="ln">11981 </span></a><span class="s0">But he doesn’t have conversational skills.</span>
<a name="l11982"><span class="ln">11982 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s … that’s exactly what it feels like.</span>
<a name="l11983"><span class="ln">11983 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Met properly,’ Moxie concedes.</span>
<a name="l11984"><span class="ln">11984 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie looks pointedly at his arms.</span>
<a name="l11985"><span class="ln">11985 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I didn’t tell anyone that either.</span>
<a name="l11986"><span class="ln">11986 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I have to tell my dad the truth.</span>
<a name="l11987"><span class="ln">11987 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll go.’ He knows this is the end.</span>
<a name="l11988"><span class="ln">11988 </span></a><span class="s0">Walking to nowhere.</span>
<a name="l11989"><span class="ln">11989 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Wait.’ Moxie stands too.</span>
<a name="l11990"><span class="ln">11990 </span></a><span class="s0">‘My dad could help you.</span>
<a name="l11991"><span class="ln">11991 </span></a><span class="s0">And there’s other stuff.</span>
<a name="l11992"><span class="ln">11992 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can’t go to prison.</span>
<a name="l11993"><span class="ln">11993 </span></a><span class="s0">I just can’t.</span>
<a name="l11994"><span class="ln">11994 </span></a><span class="s0">He’d never cope.</span>
<a name="l11995"><span class="ln">11995 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie chews her lip, her face strangely vulnerable.</span>
<a name="l11996"><span class="ln">11996 </span></a><span class="s0">I get it.’ There’s silence.</span>
<a name="l11997"><span class="ln">11997 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can’t cook,’ Moxie says, very suddenly.</span>
<a name="l11998"><span class="ln">11998 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I burn everything.</span>
<a name="l11999"><span class="ln">11999 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s a literal nightmare.’ Sam remembers scrubbing the blackened pot.</span>
<a name="l12000"><span class="ln">12000 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Do you know how to make pancakes?’ she says.</span>
<a name="l12001"><span class="ln">12001 </span></a><span class="s0">He also pretends he’s not watching Moxie.</span>
<a name="l12002"><span class="ln">12002 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie takes this in with thin lips.</span>
<a name="l12003"><span class="ln">12003 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You don’t seem like an axe murderer,’ she says finally.</span>
<a name="l12004"><span class="ln">12004 </span></a><span class="s0">And you were OK-ish that Sunday.’ ‘OK-ish?’ Sam repeats.</span>
<a name="l12005"><span class="ln">12005 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oops.’ He turns huge brown eyes up at Sam.</span>
<a name="l12006"><span class="ln">12006 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie has a very satisfied look on her face.</span>
<a name="l12007"><span class="ln">12007 </span></a><span class="s0">He flips pancakes.</span>
<a name="l12008"><span class="ln">12008 </span></a><span class="s0">And Sam makes a fine pancake.</span>
<a name="l12009"><span class="ln">12009 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re crisp around the edges and perfectly cooked inside.</span>
<a name="l12010"><span class="ln">12010 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie tears a pancake in half.</span>
<a name="l12011"><span class="ln">12011 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I know you excel at dishes, so have at it.</span>
<a name="l12012"><span class="ln">12012 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No!’ Moxie eyeballs him.</span>
<a name="l12013"><span class="ln">12013 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh yes, sir.</span>
<a name="l12014"><span class="ln">12014 </span></a><span class="s0">He does feel bad for her.</span>
<a name="l12015"><span class="ln">12015 </span></a><span class="s0">He obviously has the easier job here.</span>
<a name="l12016"><span class="ln">12016 </span></a><span class="s0">For an easy grab and run.</span>
<a name="l12017"><span class="ln">12017 </span></a><span class="s0">Absolutely pitiful, Sam.</span>
<a name="l12018"><span class="ln">12018 </span></a><span class="s0">Scared of leaving.</span>
<a name="l12019"><span class="ln">12019 </span></a><span class="s0">His leg bounces.</span>
<a name="l12020"><span class="ln">12020 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so close to Moxie and she smells of marmalade.</span>
<a name="l12021"><span class="ln">12021 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You made this?’ he says.</span>
<a name="l12022"><span class="ln">12022 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie stretches her shirt out a little to admire it.</span>
<a name="l12023"><span class="ln">12023 </span></a><span class="s0">He never wants to go.</span>
<a name="l12024"><span class="ln">12024 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s smile is sheepish.</span>
<a name="l12025"><span class="ln">12025 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t focus.</span>
<a name="l12026"><span class="ln">12026 </span></a><span class="s0">Sits beside him.</span>
<a name="l12027"><span class="ln">12027 </span></a><span class="s0">And she knows who and what he is.</span>
<a name="l12028"><span class="ln">12028 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No, you missed it.</span>
<a name="l12029"><span class="ln">12029 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie’s body relaxes and her shoulder leans against his.</span>
<a name="l12030"><span class="ln">12030 </span></a><span class="s0">The pressure is warm and soft and everything.</span>
<a name="l12031"><span class="ln">12031 </span></a><span class="s0">And he falls into it.</span>
<a name="l12032"><span class="ln">12032 </span></a><span class="s0">Just a little.</span>
<a name="l12033"><span class="ln">12033 </span></a><span class="s0">But for the barest moment between patchwork frowns, he’s wanted.</span>
<a name="l12034"><span class="ln">12034 </span></a><span class="s0">He falls asleep.</span>
<a name="l12035"><span class="ln">12035 </span></a><span class="s0">How could he?</span>
<a name="l12036"><span class="ln">12036 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam snaps awake so fast that he swallows his heart.</span>
<a name="l12037"><span class="ln">12037 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie is gone.</span>
<a name="l12038"><span class="ln">12038 </span></a><span class="s0">And the house is anything but quiet.</span>
<a name="l12039"><span class="ln">12039 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dad said we’d knock off at three.</span>
<a name="l12040"><span class="ln">12040 </span></a><span class="s0">LANGUAGE.’ Sam is suffocating.</span>
<a name="l12041"><span class="ln">12041 </span></a><span class="s0">But this time he has nowhere to hide.</span>
<a name="l12042"><span class="ln">12042 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Jack perpetually smells like a sewer.</span>
<a name="l12043"><span class="ln">12043 </span></a><span class="s0">I was cutting timber with Dad.</span>
<a name="l12044"><span class="ln">12044 </span></a><span class="s0">Directly on to Sam.</span>
<a name="l12045"><span class="ln">12045 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam catches it with his face.</span>
<a name="l12046"><span class="ln">12046 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh,’ says Jack, backtracking to stare.</span>
<a name="l12047"><span class="ln">12047 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to run.</span>
<a name="l12048"><span class="ln">12048 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to run right now.</span>
<a name="l12049"><span class="ln">12049 </span></a><span class="s0">‘My friend Sam is staying for dinner,’ she announces.</span>
<a name="l12050"><span class="ln">12050 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And isn’t it Jack’s night to cook?</span>
<a name="l12051"><span class="ln">12051 </span></a><span class="s0">He narrows his eyes at Moxie.</span>
<a name="l12052"><span class="ln">12052 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Language.’ ‘Sorry.’ Moxie raises her hands innocently.</span>
<a name="l12053"><span class="ln">12053 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m overworked and underpaid,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l12054"><span class="ln">12054 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie waves vaguely at the room.</span>
<a name="l12055"><span class="ln">12055 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Wait, he’s your friend?</span>
<a name="l12056"><span class="ln">12056 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hmm, oops.’ Considering his recent decisions, she’s not wrong.</span>
<a name="l12057"><span class="ln">12057 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Let’s worry about that later.</span>
<a name="l12058"><span class="ln">12058 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You look tired, Sam.</span>
<a name="l12059"><span class="ln">12059 </span></a><span class="s0">But not on the topic she has in mind.</span>
<a name="l12060"><span class="ln">12060 </span></a><span class="s0">A dress dummy displays a pinned outfit of emerald green.</span>
<a name="l12061"><span class="ln">12061 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie’s smile is wry.</span>
<a name="l12062"><span class="ln">12062 </span></a><span class="s0">Dinner is loud and messy and intoxicatingly alive.</span>
<a name="l12063"><span class="ln">12063 </span></a><span class="s0">Also because he’s far away from Mr De Lainey.</span>
<a name="l12064"><span class="ln">12064 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam just … he can’t with adults.</span>
<a name="l12065"><span class="ln">12065 </span></a><span class="s0">They frown, they shout, they hit.</span>
<a name="l12066"><span class="ln">12066 </span></a><span class="s0">Just in case.</span>
<a name="l12067"><span class="ln">12067 </span></a><span class="s0">The baby faceplants in a bowl of sauce.</span>
<a name="l12068"><span class="ln">12068 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie pokes Sam’s leg under the table.</span>
<a name="l12069"><span class="ln">12069 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He’s the softest squish you’ll ever meet.</span>
<a name="l12070"><span class="ln">12070 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam shovels in food to hide the smile.</span>
<a name="l12071"><span class="ln">12071 </span></a><span class="s0">‘So, Moxie.’ Mr De Lainey clears his throat.</span>
<a name="l12072"><span class="ln">12072 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re taking my weekend now?’ Her father sighs.</span>
<a name="l12073"><span class="ln">12073 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Moxie …’ ‘Oh, it’s fine.’ Moxie’s teeth clench.</span>
<a name="l12074"><span class="ln">12074 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie snatches her fork and stabs a meatball.</span>
<a name="l12075"><span class="ln">12075 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No,’ Moxie snaps.</span>
<a name="l12076"><span class="ln">12076 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No and no.’ The baby’s lip juts out.</span>
<a name="l12077"><span class="ln">12077 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Seriously, Moxie?’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l12078"><span class="ln">12078 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You never have to look after them.</span>
<a name="l12079"><span class="ln">12079 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m only fifteen.</span>
<a name="l12080"><span class="ln">12080 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m a kid too.</span>
<a name="l12081"><span class="ln">12081 </span></a><span class="s0">‘All right, let’s calm down,’ Mr De Lainey says.</span>
<a name="l12082"><span class="ln">12082 </span></a><span class="s0">No one listens.</span>
<a name="l12083"><span class="ln">12083 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I never get to stop,’ Moxie shoots back.</span>
<a name="l12084"><span class="ln">12084 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Who got up for the baby last night?</span>
<a name="l12085"><span class="ln">12085 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Who’s been up since five with Toby?</span>
<a name="l12086"><span class="ln">12086 </span></a><span class="s0">But in that moment, his heart tugs for Moxie.</span>
<a name="l12087"><span class="ln">12087 </span></a><span class="s0">He gets it.</span>
<a name="l12088"><span class="ln">12088 </span></a><span class="s0">A life tangled with siblings who can’t look after themselves?</span>

<a name="l12090"><span class="ln">12090 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We all miss Mum,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l12091"><span class="ln">12091 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Grady,’ Mr De Lainey calls, sounding a little desperate.</span>
<a name="l12092"><span class="ln">12092 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey, just wait a —’ The front door bangs.</span>
<a name="l12093"><span class="ln">12093 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr De Lainey puts his head in his hands.</span>
<a name="l12094"><span class="ln">12094 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack snaps garlic bread in half.</span>
<a name="l12095"><span class="ln">12095 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Come on.’ It’s a command.</span>
<a name="l12096"><span class="ln">12096 </span></a><span class="s0">They sweep upstairs and leave the clatter of crying below.</span>
<a name="l12097"><span class="ln">12097 </span></a><span class="s0">But she doesn’t.</span>
<a name="l12098"><span class="ln">12098 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ve seen worse,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l12099"><span class="ln">12099 </span></a><span class="s0">He should not have said anything.</span>
<a name="l12100"><span class="ln">12100 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Long time ago.’ ‘OK, wow.</span>
<a name="l12101"><span class="ln">12101 </span></a><span class="s0">I am such a jerk.’ ‘No …’ Sam’s heart thuds.</span>
<a name="l12102"><span class="ln">12102 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s – you’re allowed to hurt.</span>
<a name="l12103"><span class="ln">12103 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I really miss my mum,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l12104"><span class="ln">12104 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam looks out the window at the darkening sky.</span>
<a name="l12105"><span class="ln">12105 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I should go.’ Sam doesn’t move.</span>
<a name="l12106"><span class="ln">12106 </span></a><span class="s0">He thinks of the school.</span>
<a name="l12107"><span class="ln">12107 </span></a><span class="s0">He’d give anything to stay like this.</span>
<a name="l12108"><span class="ln">12108 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Just sleep in the office again,’ she says finally.</span>
<a name="l12109"><span class="ln">12109 </span></a><span class="s0">She presents fingers of glitter in proof.</span>
<a name="l12110"><span class="ln">12110 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t do this.</span>
<a name="l12111"><span class="ln">12111 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t know how.</span>
<a name="l12112"><span class="ln">12112 </span></a><span class="s0">Shouts and voices have dimmed as kids load into buses.</span>
<a name="l12113"><span class="ln">12113 </span></a><span class="s0">His shirt is inside out, collar popped, tags fluttering.</span>
<a name="l12114"><span class="ln">12114 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks happy.</span>
<a name="l12115"><span class="ln">12115 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy stares at him.</span>
<a name="l12116"><span class="ln">12116 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I kissed Elle,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l12117"><span class="ln">12117 </span></a><span class="s0">Stop.’ Sammy pulls the paper out of his nose.</span>
<a name="l12118"><span class="ln">12118 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re talking way too fast.’ Not just talking.</span>
<a name="l12119"><span class="ln">12119 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s going way too fast for Sammy to keep up.</span>
<a name="l12120"><span class="ln">12120 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s going too fast.</span>
<a name="l12121"><span class="ln">12121 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not like them.</span>
<a name="l12122"><span class="ln">12122 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s going to get hurt.</span>
<a name="l12123"><span class="ln">12123 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You can’t go around kissing.</span>
<a name="l12124"><span class="ln">12124 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy tries to steady himself.</span>
<a name="l12125"><span class="ln">12125 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not ready for this kind of conversation with Avery.</span>
<a name="l12126"><span class="ln">12126 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Because,’ he says, closing his eyes, ‘they’re messing with you.</span>
<a name="l12127"><span class="ln">12127 </span></a><span class="s0">To hurt you.’ Avery frowns.</span>
<a name="l12128"><span class="ln">12128 </span></a><span class="s0">Isn’t that nice for him?</span>
<a name="l12129"><span class="ln">12129 </span></a><span class="s0">His bottom lip juts out and he looks wounded.</span>
<a name="l12130"><span class="ln">12130 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I could earn money, right?</span>
<a name="l12131"><span class="ln">12131 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy has the dull feeling that he’s being manipulated.</span>
<a name="l12132"><span class="ln">12132 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Did you say you’re going with them now?’ Sammy says.</span>
<a name="l12133"><span class="ln">12133 </span></a><span class="s0">Not the kind of people Sammy wants Avery around.</span>
<a name="l12134"><span class="ln">12134 </span></a><span class="s0">All crass jokes and cold smirks.</span>
<a name="l12135"><span class="ln">12135 </span></a><span class="s0">Does Sammy want Avery around anyone?</span>
<a name="l12136"><span class="ln">12136 </span></a><span class="s0">He picks friends badly.</span>
<a name="l12137"><span class="ln">12137 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re not going to anyone’s house,’ Sammy says.</span>
<a name="l12138"><span class="ln">12138 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’re going back to Aunt Karen’s.’ Avery’s eyes narrow.</span>
<a name="l12139"><span class="ln">12139 </span></a><span class="s0">How’s Sam supposed to explain?</span>
<a name="l12140"><span class="ln">12140 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t know how to let go of Avery.</span>
<a name="l12141"><span class="ln">12141 </span></a><span class="s0">Doesn’t think it’s the right time.</span>
<a name="l12142"><span class="ln">12142 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You can’t have both.</span>
<a name="l12143"><span class="ln">12143 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like being a kid versus growing up.</span>
<a name="l12144"><span class="ln">12144 </span></a><span class="s0">A reason amongst millions that he’s not ready for this.</span>
<a name="l12145"><span class="ln">12145 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery pulls the toy car out of his pocket.</span>
<a name="l12146"><span class="ln">12146 </span></a><span class="s0">He flips it over with long thin fingers, staring.</span>
<a name="l12147"><span class="ln">12147 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy tests his nose.</span>
<a name="l12148"><span class="ln">12148 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery bounces to his feet.</span>
<a name="l12149"><span class="ln">12149 </span></a><span class="s0">One waves him over.</span>
<a name="l12150"><span class="ln">12150 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy’s fingers close over the toy car.</span>
<a name="l12151"><span class="ln">12151 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Please, just listen.</span>
<a name="l12152"><span class="ln">12152 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I mean,’ Sammy says, teeth grating, ‘under your clothes.</span>
<a name="l12153"><span class="ln">12153 </span></a><span class="s0">If clothes cover it, you can’t touch it.</span>
<a name="l12154"><span class="ln">12154 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s the rule, OK?</span>
<a name="l12155"><span class="ln">12155 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You hit people.</span>
<a name="l12156"><span class="ln">12156 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s worse than anything West does.</span>
<a name="l12157"><span class="ln">12157 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s bad, Sammy.</span>
<a name="l12158"><span class="ln">12158 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s so so bad.’ Sammy’s teeth clench.</span>
<a name="l12159"><span class="ln">12159 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I didn’t hit anyone.</span>
<a name="l12160"><span class="ln">12160 </span></a><span class="s0">I promised I’d stop, didn’t I?</span>
<a name="l12161"><span class="ln">12161 </span></a><span class="s0">They jumped me.’ Avery flicks his fingers by his ear.</span>
<a name="l12162"><span class="ln">12162 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t belong to just you.</span>
<a name="l12163"><span class="ln">12163 </span></a><span class="s0">His smile is puppy-dog wide.</span>
<a name="l12164"><span class="ln">12164 </span></a><span class="s0">Innocent and anxiously excited.</span>
<a name="l12165"><span class="ln">12165 </span></a><span class="s0">West drapes an arm over his shoulder.</span>
<a name="l12166"><span class="ln">12166 </span></a><span class="s0">Laughs at him.</span>
<a name="l12167"><span class="ln">12167 </span></a><span class="s0">Or with him?</span>
<a name="l12168"><span class="ln">12168 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy looks down at the toy car in his hand.</span>
<a name="l12169"><span class="ln">12169 </span></a><span class="s0">A tear hits it, hot and wet.</span>
<a name="l12170"><span class="ln">12170 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s stupid to be crying.</span>
<a name="l12171"><span class="ln">12171 </span></a><span class="s0">Their routine becomes pleasantly seamless after a week.</span>
<a name="l12172"><span class="ln">12172 </span></a><span class="s0">They come out faster the more he’s around Moxie.</span>
<a name="l12173"><span class="ln">12173 </span></a><span class="s0">Wow, he actually has opinions.</span>
<a name="l12174"><span class="ln">12174 </span></a><span class="s0">This could be you.’ Sam looks up, alarmed.</span>
<a name="l12175"><span class="ln">12175 </span></a><span class="s0">You’d need to cut your hair though.</span>
<a name="l12176"><span class="ln">12176 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But do you actually like it long?</span>
<a name="l12177"><span class="ln">12177 </span></a><span class="s0">Because you could just get it tidied.</span>
<a name="l12178"><span class="ln">12178 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s a sticky mess.</span>
<a name="l12179"><span class="ln">12179 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll cut it.’ There’s a dangerous spark in her eyes.</span>
<a name="l12180"><span class="ln">12180 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam is decidedly nervous.</span>
<a name="l12181"><span class="ln">12181 </span></a><span class="s0">And he doesn’t want to see disgust in her eyes.</span>
<a name="l12182"><span class="ln">12182 </span></a><span class="s0">She ruffles fingers through his hair.</span>
<a name="l12183"><span class="ln">12183 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And what cities have you felled today?</span>
<a name="l12184"><span class="ln">12184 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re next, Jack.</span>
<a name="l12185"><span class="ln">12185 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He’s going to get the shower first,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l12186"><span class="ln">12186 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy clambers through the gate.</span>
<a name="l12187"><span class="ln">12187 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re friends … right?</span>
<a name="l12188"><span class="ln">12188 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie snorts and waits till they’re gone before scooting closer.</span>
<a name="l12189"><span class="ln">12189 </span></a><span class="s0">Spiderwebs of sensations dart across his skull.</span>
<a name="l12190"><span class="ln">12190 </span></a><span class="s0">The scissors snip.</span>
<a name="l12191"><span class="ln">12191 </span></a><span class="s0">Wisps of corn silk strands drop on to Sam’s shoulders.</span>
<a name="l12192"><span class="ln">12192 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It would look so good on you.</span>
<a name="l12193"><span class="ln">12193 </span></a><span class="s0">But I’m …’ ‘Remarkably pretty.</span>
<a name="l12194"><span class="ln">12194 </span></a><span class="s0">She fluffs hair out from behind his ears.</span>
<a name="l12195"><span class="ln">12195 </span></a><span class="s0">Can she feel them burning hot?</span>
<a name="l12196"><span class="ln">12196 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie jerks back.</span>
<a name="l12197"><span class="ln">12197 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh no.’ Sam’s shoulders straighten.</span>
<a name="l12198"><span class="ln">12198 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What do you mean “oh no”?’ ‘Um.’ Panic hits.</span>
<a name="l12199"><span class="ln">12199 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Moxie.’ ‘OK, OK, don’t stress.</span>
<a name="l12200"><span class="ln">12200 </span></a><span class="s0">I just …’ There’s a tense pause.</span>
<a name="l12201"><span class="ln">12201 </span></a><span class="s0">‘JEREMY,’ she hollers.</span>
<a name="l12202"><span class="ln">12202 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What’s going on?</span>
<a name="l12203"><span class="ln">12203 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie.’ ‘I don’t understand,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l12204"><span class="ln">12204 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I watched three tutorials.’ ‘That is confusing,’ Jeremy says.</span>
<a name="l12205"><span class="ln">12205 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam drops his face in his hands.</span>
<a name="l12206"><span class="ln">12206 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s considerably less exhilarating.</span>
<a name="l12207"><span class="ln">12207 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Shorter at the sides and longer at the top.</span>
<a name="l12208"><span class="ln">12208 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s going to be bald.</span>
<a name="l12209"><span class="ln">12209 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You have a buzz cut,’ Sam says, voice thin.</span>
<a name="l12210"><span class="ln">12210 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie takes a bite of his sandwich.</span>
<a name="l12211"><span class="ln">12211 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l12212"><span class="ln">12212 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He donated it to cancer kids.</span>
<a name="l12213"><span class="ln">12213 </span></a><span class="s0">How long did it get, Jeremy?</span>
<a name="l12214"><span class="ln">12214 </span></a><span class="s0">And totally unfocused.</span>
<a name="l12215"><span class="ln">12215 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam resists covering his ears in hopes of protecting them.</span>
<a name="l12216"><span class="ln">12216 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You were majestic,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l12217"><span class="ln">12217 </span></a><span class="s0">A lot of hair.</span>
<a name="l12218"><span class="ln">12218 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Go find a mirror.’ ‘I don’t want to,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l12219"><span class="ln">12219 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s not too bad.</span>
<a name="l12220"><span class="ln">12220 </span></a><span class="s0">His head feels strangely naked and he can actually see.</span>
<a name="l12221"><span class="ln">12221 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well, wow, Jeremy!</span>
<a name="l12222"><span class="ln">12222 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he notices Jeremy’s looking at his ribs.</span>
<a name="l12223"><span class="ln">12223 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s nothing.’ Sam looks away.</span>
<a name="l12224"><span class="ln">12224 </span></a><span class="s0">‘The ribs, however.’ ‘Unacceptable,’ says Jeremy.</span>
<a name="l12225"><span class="ln">12225 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He’s staying for dinner right, Moxie?</span>
<a name="l12226"><span class="ln">12226 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But really, Sam.</span>
<a name="l12227"><span class="ln">12227 </span></a><span class="s0">Any time.’ Sunshine crackles back into his eyes.</span>
<a name="l12228"><span class="ln">12228 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m making brownies.’ He ducks back into the house.</span>
<a name="l12229"><span class="ln">12229 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Make it caramel!’ Moxie yells at his back.</span>
<a name="l12230"><span class="ln">12230 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That was fun.’ Sam itches his neck.</span>
<a name="l12231"><span class="ln">12231 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Not really, no.’ ‘And you have a whole face.</span>
<a name="l12232"><span class="ln">12232 </span></a><span class="s0">She musses his hair again, frowning as she arranges it.</span>
<a name="l12233"><span class="ln">12233 </span></a><span class="s0">She’s so close, her hands all through his hair.</span>
<a name="l12234"><span class="ln">12234 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I like your eyes,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l12235"><span class="ln">12235 </span></a><span class="s0">She has no idea, does she?</span>
<a name="l12236"><span class="ln">12236 </span></a><span class="s0">What she does to his heart.</span>
<a name="l12237"><span class="ln">12237 </span></a><span class="s0">Sympathy is not her strong point.</span>
<a name="l12238"><span class="ln">12238 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll check on him tomorrow.</span>
<a name="l12239"><span class="ln">12239 </span></a><span class="s0">Make sure he’s eating.</span>
<a name="l12240"><span class="ln">12240 </span></a><span class="s0">Make sure he’s not on the edge of a meltdown.</span>
<a name="l12241"><span class="ln">12241 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Mayfair,’ she crows.</span>
<a name="l12242"><span class="ln">12242 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey, don’t do that,’ Jeremy says, petting him tenderly.</span>
<a name="l12243"><span class="ln">12243 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Phone.’ Jack looks helplessly at Jeremy.</span>
<a name="l12244"><span class="ln">12244 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He started—’ His father snaps his fingers.</span>
<a name="l12245"><span class="ln">12245 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Soon,’ Moxie says fiercely.</span>
<a name="l12246"><span class="ln">12246 </span></a><span class="s0">His chest tugs.</span>
<a name="l12247"><span class="ln">12247 </span></a><span class="s0">Two weeks is a lot of lying.</span>
<a name="l12248"><span class="ln">12248 </span></a><span class="s0">‘OK, take it off,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l12249"><span class="ln">12249 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Half the time they just text me anyway.</span>
<a name="l12250"><span class="ln">12250 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like, expected.’ ‘Dad picks on me,’ Jack says.</span>
<a name="l12251"><span class="ln">12251 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie reappears with an armful of garments.</span>
<a name="l12252"><span class="ln">12252 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Who do I kill with this?’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l12253"><span class="ln">12253 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That’s an unpicker, you goat.</span>
<a name="l12254"><span class="ln">12254 </span></a><span class="s0">And these are second-hand clothes.</span>
<a name="l12255"><span class="ln">12255 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack makes an exasperated sound.</span>
<a name="l12256"><span class="ln">12256 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam swivels the small torture instrument.</span>
<a name="l12257"><span class="ln">12257 </span></a><span class="s0">It feels like a lock pick.</span>
<a name="l12258"><span class="ln">12258 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Since they’re all completely useless.’ ‘Excuse me,’ Jeremy says.</span>
<a name="l12259"><span class="ln">12259 </span></a><span class="s0">Last year, I think.’ ‘I rest my case,’ Moxie mutters.</span>
<a name="l12260"><span class="ln">12260 </span></a><span class="s0">Grady appears, rubbing his eyes until his glasses are askew.</span>
<a name="l12261"><span class="ln">12261 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What’d I miss?’ ‘Everything,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l12262"><span class="ln">12262 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Why don’t you just buy clothes?</span>
<a name="l12263"><span class="ln">12263 </span></a><span class="s0">Save time.’ Moxie slams her scissors down, nostrils flaring.</span>
<a name="l12264"><span class="ln">12264 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh, here we go,’ Jeremy says.</span>

<a name="l12448"><span class="ln">12448 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t want it to end?</span>

<a name="l12455"><span class="ln">12455 </span></a><span class="s0">‘AHEM.’ Moxie shrieks and falls backwards off the sofa.</span>
<a name="l12456"><span class="ln">12456 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam shoots upright, guilt plastered thickly on his face.</span>

<a name="l12461"><span class="ln">12461 </span></a><span class="s0">Like he hasn’t been staying here for weeks.</span>
<a name="l12462"><span class="ln">12462 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy looks confused.</span>
<a name="l12463"><span class="ln">12463 </span></a><span class="s0">Wow, you weirdos.’ He turns to go and then backtracks.</span>
<a name="l12464"><span class="ln">12464 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I guess you don’t need advice, Sammy.’ He winks.</span>
<a name="l12465"><span class="ln">12465 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam pulls a pillow over his face.</span>

<a name="l12498"><span class="ln">12498 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Perfect,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l12499"><span class="ln">12499 </span></a><span class="s0">Then kisses him again.</span>
<a name="l12500"><span class="ln">12500 </span></a><span class="s0">It matches her hair.</span>

<a name="l12504"><span class="ln">12504 </span></a><span class="s0">It tumbles out in anguish.</span>
<a name="l12505"><span class="ln">12505 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s never a tantrum.</span>
<a name="l12506"><span class="ln">12506 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie’s fingers curl over Sam’s arm.</span>
<a name="l12507"><span class="ln">12507 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Who is she?</span>
<a name="l12508"><span class="ln">12508 </span></a><span class="s0">Engine still running.</span>

<a name="l12510"><span class="ln">12510 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I have to go.’ Sam turns to Moxie, desperate now.</span>
<a name="l12511"><span class="ln">12511 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Please, just …’ Just what, Sam?</span>
<a name="l12512"><span class="ln">12512 </span></a><span class="s0">Just what the hell will you tell her?</span>
<a name="l12513"><span class="ln">12513 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Tell me what’s going on!’ Moxie cries from the doorway.</span>
<a name="l12514"><span class="ln">12514 </span></a><span class="s0">He gets into Vin’s car.</span>
<a name="l12515"><span class="ln">12515 </span></a><span class="s0">All he has is a desperate need for Avery.</span>
<a name="l12516"><span class="ln">12516 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Tell me what happened.’ Sam’s voice is too high.</span>
<a name="l12517"><span class="ln">12517 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Where is he?</span>
<a name="l12518"><span class="ln">12518 </span></a><span class="s0">At your place?</span>
<a name="l12519"><span class="ln">12519 </span></a><span class="s0">Since he can’t shut up.</span>
<a name="l12520"><span class="ln">12520 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin’s only kindness is truly selfishness.</span>
<a name="l12521"><span class="ln">12521 </span></a><span class="s0">The car spins downtown.</span>
<a name="l12522"><span class="ln">12522 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He’s autistic.’ Sam grinds each word like crushed glass.</span>
<a name="l12523"><span class="ln">12523 </span></a><span class="s0">And you threw it all at him?</span>
<a name="l12524"><span class="ln">12524 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like being hit in the stomach.</span>
<a name="l12525"><span class="ln">12525 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam rips out of his seat before they even stop.</span>
<a name="l12526"><span class="ln">12526 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t hear Vin follow.</span>
<a name="l12527"><span class="ln">12527 </span></a><span class="s0">His own work.</span>
<a name="l12528"><span class="ln">12528 </span></a><span class="s0">His world is spinning out from under him.</span>
<a name="l12529"><span class="ln">12529 </span></a><span class="s0">He screams and screams.</span>
<a name="l12530"><span class="ln">12530 </span></a><span class="s0">They’ve pushed him too much.</span>
<a name="l12531"><span class="ln">12531 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No, just leave him alone.</span>
<a name="l12532"><span class="ln">12532 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ve got him.</span>

<a name="l12536"><span class="ln">12536 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s fist connects with Sam’s stomach.</span>
<a name="l12537"><span class="ln">12537 </span></a><span class="s0">again Sam takes it all with the smallest grunt.</span>
<a name="l12538"><span class="ln">12538 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam doesn’t care.</span>
<a name="l12539"><span class="ln">12539 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re OK.’ ‘I c-c-c-can’t—’ ‘You don’t have to,’ Sam whispers.</span>

<a name="l12541"><span class="ln">12541 </span></a><span class="s0">… embarrassing me, she’d said.</span>
<a name="l12542"><span class="ln">12542 </span></a><span class="s0">How’s he going to move Avery?</span>
<a name="l12543"><span class="ln">12543 </span></a><span class="s0">They have nowhere to go.</span>
<a name="l12544"><span class="ln">12544 </span></a><span class="s0">Life is always so sickeningly cruel.</span>
<a name="l12545"><span class="ln">12545 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam holds him tighter.</span>
<a name="l12546"><span class="ln">12546 </span></a><span class="s0">He knows where to go.</span>
<a name="l12547"><span class="ln">12547 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t be doing this.</span>
<a name="l12548"><span class="ln">12548 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll ruin everything.</span>
<a name="l12549"><span class="ln">12549 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s doing this.</span>
<a name="l12550"><span class="ln">12550 </span></a><span class="s0">He hates being this cruel.</span>
<a name="l12551"><span class="ln">12551 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s soul is bleeding out.</span>
<a name="l12552"><span class="ln">12552 </span></a><span class="s0">But they made it.</span>
<a name="l12553"><span class="ln">12553 </span></a><span class="s0">She’ll be furious he ran out like that.</span>
<a name="l12554"><span class="ln">12554 </span></a><span class="s0">Their kiss, so sweet before, feels like memories of ash.</span>
<a name="l12555"><span class="ln">12555 </span></a><span class="s0">The shirt is probably Jeremy’s.</span>
<a name="l12556"><span class="ln">12556 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam has so much stealing to apologise for.</span>
<a name="l12557"><span class="ln">12557 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I c-c-c-can’t …’ He stops.</span>
<a name="l12558"><span class="ln">12558 </span></a><span class="s0">A sob tears free.</span>
<a name="l12559"><span class="ln">12559 </span></a><span class="s0">Pressure to calm him.</span>
<a name="l12560"><span class="ln">12560 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s breathing slows as Sam holds him tight.</span>
<a name="l12561"><span class="ln">12561 </span></a><span class="s0">A sandwich of Lou boys in a stolen house.</span>
<a name="l12562"><span class="ln">12562 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We have to be quiet,’ Sam whispers.</span>
<a name="l12563"><span class="ln">12563 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But tomorrow I … I’m going to fix it.</span>
<a name="l12564"><span class="ln">12564 </span></a><span class="s0">No, the De Laineys are not like that.</span>
<a name="l12565"><span class="ln">12565 </span></a><span class="s0">Failing owning one, Sam decided to be one.</span>
<a name="l12566"><span class="ln">12566 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m … I’m sorry I wasn’t there.</span>
<a name="l12567"><span class="ln">12567 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he goes completely still.</span>
<a name="l12568"><span class="ln">12568 </span></a><span class="s0">A small sigh escapes.</span>
<a name="l12569"><span class="ln">12569 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam would save him a million times.</span>
<a name="l12570"><span class="ln">12570 </span></a><span class="s0">He’d never hesitate.</span>
<a name="l12571"><span class="ln">12571 </span></a><span class="s0">But you can’t hide Avery.</span>
<a name="l12572"><span class="ln">12572 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s perfect summer is a hot slap against his cheek.</span>
<a name="l12573"><span class="ln">12573 </span></a><span class="s0">He wakes to a toe in his ribs.</span>
<a name="l12574"><span class="ln">12574 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam jerks toward the sofa but it’s empty.</span>
<a name="l12575"><span class="ln">12575 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I need explanations,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l12576"><span class="ln">12576 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Many of them.</span>
<a name="l12577"><span class="ln">12577 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What the hell, Sam?’ He kneads his eyes.</span>
<a name="l12578"><span class="ln">12578 </span></a><span class="s0">‘My … my brother needed help.’ Where is he?</span>
<a name="l12579"><span class="ln">12579 </span></a><span class="s0">But I have to ask now, Sam.</span>
<a name="l12580"><span class="ln">12580 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Is this your autistic brother?</span>
<a name="l12581"><span class="ln">12581 </span></a><span class="s0">Is he safe right now?’ ‘I don’t know,’ Sam whispers.</span>
<a name="l12582"><span class="ln">12582 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We need to tell my dad,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l12583"><span class="ln">12583 </span></a><span class="s0">He opens his mouth to – what?</span>
<a name="l12584"><span class="ln">12584 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe just agree?</span>
<a name="l12585"><span class="ln">12585 </span></a><span class="s0">Do you have an extremely cute and slightly taller doppelgänger?</span>
<a name="l12586"><span class="ln">12586 </span></a><span class="s0">Because one is currently abusing our poor gate.</span>
<a name="l12587"><span class="ln">12587 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam left his heartbeat inside.</span>
<a name="l12588"><span class="ln">12588 </span></a><span class="s0">But Avery’s OK.</span>
<a name="l12589"><span class="ln">12589 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Where’d you go?’ Sam says softly.</span>
<a name="l12590"><span class="ln">12590 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Come back inside.</span>
<a name="l12591"><span class="ln">12591 </span></a><span class="s0">His eyes are smudged with exhaustion, his lips bitten bloody.</span>
<a name="l12592"><span class="ln">12592 </span></a><span class="s0">‘If you tell, they’ll s-send you to jail,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l12593"><span class="ln">12593 </span></a><span class="s0">‘All … this?</span>
<a name="l12594"><span class="ln">12594 </span></a><span class="s0">Sunday night waffles.</span>
<a name="l12595"><span class="ln">12595 </span></a><span class="s0">Lying on the grass with mango pips.</span>
<a name="l12596"><span class="ln">12596 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam leans across the gate.</span>
<a name="l12597"><span class="ln">12597 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll risk it for you.</span>
<a name="l12598"><span class="ln">12598 </span></a><span class="s0">I rebuilt her car.’ His split lips tip downwards.</span>
<a name="l12599"><span class="ln">12599 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t be like that.’ Sam’s voice stays low.</span>
<a name="l12600"><span class="ln">12600 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You really can’t.’ Heat flares in Sam’s chest.</span>
<a name="l12601"><span class="ln">12601 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You just fall apart.</span>
<a name="l12602"><span class="ln">12602 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks wretched, tired and hollowed out.</span>
<a name="l12603"><span class="ln">12603 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s throat closes.</span>
<a name="l12604"><span class="ln">12604 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I like your hands better this way,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l12605"><span class="ln">12605 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam looks down in confusion.</span>
<a name="l12606"><span class="ln">12606 </span></a><span class="s0">His knuckles are smooth.</span>
<a name="l12607"><span class="ln">12607 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Vin says you’re soft.</span>
<a name="l12608"><span class="ln">12608 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You don’t belong in a house,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l12609"><span class="ln">12609 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’re the kings of nowhere, remember?</span>
<a name="l12610"><span class="ln">12610 </span></a><span class="s0">No one can solve the puzzle that is Sammy Lou.</span>
<a name="l12611"><span class="ln">12611 </span></a><span class="s0">They shouldn’t even try.</span>
<a name="l12612"><span class="ln">12612 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You can call Vin if you need me.</span>
<a name="l12613"><span class="ln">12613 </span></a><span class="s0">But I’m leaving now.’ If he needs Avery?</span>
<a name="l12614"><span class="ln">12614 </span></a><span class="s0">More like when Avery needs him.</span>
<a name="l12615"><span class="ln">12615 </span></a><span class="s0">But he thinks Avery means it.</span>
<a name="l12616"><span class="ln">12616 </span></a><span class="s0">He thinks Avery’s trying to be a big brother.</span>
<a name="l12617"><span class="ln">12617 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam could laugh.</span>
<a name="l12618"><span class="ln">12618 </span></a><span class="s0">Or maybe just cry.</span>
<a name="l12619"><span class="ln">12619 </span></a><span class="s0">But he doesn’t.</span>
<a name="l12620"><span class="ln">12620 </span></a><span class="s0">‘After the beach party,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l12621"><span class="ln">12621 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Then we’re officially talking to my dad.</span>
<a name="l12622"><span class="ln">12622 </span></a><span class="s0">About everything.’ He just nods.</span>
<a name="l12623"><span class="ln">12623 </span></a><span class="s0">No, he’s not.</span>
<a name="l12624"><span class="ln">12624 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam looks down at his fingers wrapped around Avery’s phone.</span>

<a name="l12626"><span class="ln">12626 </span></a><span class="s0">But having dozens of eyes look at him?</span>
<a name="l12627"><span class="ln">12627 </span></a><span class="s0">He loathes that.</span>
<a name="l12628"><span class="ln">12628 </span></a><span class="s0">Six pairs of eyes immediately lock on Sam.</span>
<a name="l12629"><span class="ln">12629 </span></a><span class="s0">You look incredible.</span>
<a name="l12630"><span class="ln">12630 </span></a><span class="s0">The waistcoat is marvellous.</span>
<a name="l12631"><span class="ln">12631 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s burgundy and rust and charcoal and gold.</span>
<a name="l12632"><span class="ln">12632 </span></a><span class="s0">And it’s slim fitting.</span>
<a name="l12633"><span class="ln">12633 </span></a><span class="s0">No one will know.</span>
<a name="l12634"><span class="ln">12634 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs it.</span>
<a name="l12635"><span class="ln">12635 </span></a><span class="s0">No one has ever called Sam a gentleman before.</span>
<a name="l12636"><span class="ln">12636 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t think about it right now.</span>
<a name="l12637"><span class="ln">12637 </span></a><span class="s0">Jack doesn’t look up from his phone.</span>
<a name="l12638"><span class="ln">12638 </span></a><span class="s0">‘The sun’s not fully down yet.</span>
<a name="l12639"><span class="ln">12639 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No,’ says Jack.</span>
<a name="l12640"><span class="ln">12640 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What have you been doing all this time?’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l12641"><span class="ln">12641 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr De Lainey pops raisins in his mouth.</span>
<a name="l12642"><span class="ln">12642 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well.’ He pauses.</span>
<a name="l12643"><span class="ln">12643 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Well … you need pants.’ Jeremy looks down.</span>
<a name="l12644"><span class="ln">12644 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Oh, yeah.’ ‘And a different shirt,’ Jack adds, stealing gingerbread.</span>
<a name="l12645"><span class="ln">12645 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy nods several times and bolts back upstairs.</span>
<a name="l12646"><span class="ln">12646 </span></a><span class="s0">I need to wear a salmon.</span>
<a name="l12647"><span class="ln">12647 </span></a><span class="s0">OK.’ Moxie glances at Jack.</span>
<a name="l12648"><span class="ln">12648 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Does he have a new crush?</span>
<a name="l12649"><span class="ln">12649 </span></a><span class="s0">Is that why he’s flapping?’ Jack shrugs.</span>
<a name="l12650"><span class="ln">12650 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No.’ Jack puts his phone behind his back.</span>
<a name="l12651"><span class="ln">12651 </span></a><span class="s0">Their father sighs and looks very old.</span>
<a name="l12652"><span class="ln">12652 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam nudges Moxie with his knee.</span>
<a name="l12653"><span class="ln">12653 </span></a><span class="s0">Whatever that means.</span>
<a name="l12654"><span class="ln">12654 </span></a><span class="s0">But the dress has a secret.</span>
<a name="l12655"><span class="ln">12655 </span></a><span class="s0">The skirt flares out to a perfect circle.</span>
<a name="l12656"><span class="ln">12656 </span></a><span class="s0">She is the sun and her eyes burn stars.</span>
<a name="l12657"><span class="ln">12657 </span></a><span class="s0">Her smile is glory and pride and infectious delight.</span>
<a name="l12658"><span class="ln">12658 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr De Lainey looks like he’s about to cry.</span>
<a name="l12659"><span class="ln">12659 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Moxie, darling, you’re beautiful.</span>
<a name="l12660"><span class="ln">12660 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m taking a picture.</span>
<a name="l12661"><span class="ln">12661 </span></a><span class="s0">Everyone on the stairs!</span>
<a name="l12662"><span class="ln">12662 </span></a><span class="s0">They shuffle and poke each other.</span>
<a name="l12663"><span class="ln">12663 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy leans on Grady.</span>
<a name="l12664"><span class="ln">12664 </span></a><span class="s0">Dash picks up Toby.</span>
<a name="l12665"><span class="ln">12665 </span></a><span class="s0">A stray curl falls over Moxie’s eyes.</span>
<a name="l12666"><span class="ln">12666 </span></a><span class="s0">They share a smile.</span>
<a name="l12667"><span class="ln">12667 </span></a><span class="s0">It really, really hurts.</span>
<a name="l12668"><span class="ln">12668 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t lose this.</span>
<a name="l12669"><span class="ln">12669 </span></a><span class="s0">The beach is a fairyland of lights like broken stars.</span>
<a name="l12670"><span class="ln">12670 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s mostly kids from school,’ Grady says.</span>
<a name="l12671"><span class="ln">12671 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And their friends and friends of friends.</span>
<a name="l12672"><span class="ln">12672 </span></a><span class="s0">The rich ones started it.</span>
<a name="l12673"><span class="ln">12673 </span></a><span class="s0">Rich kids get away with a lot.’ Sam won’t argue.</span>
<a name="l12674"><span class="ln">12674 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam ignores his tightening lungs.</span>
<a name="l12675"><span class="ln">12675 </span></a><span class="s0">Everything clashes together.</span>
<a name="l12676"><span class="ln">12676 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t freak out.</span>
<a name="l12677"><span class="ln">12677 </span></a><span class="s0">No one knows you.</span>
<a name="l12678"><span class="ln">12678 </span></a><span class="s0">There is no way anyone here will recognise you.</span>
<a name="l12679"><span class="ln">12679 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Anyway, why are you saying “we”?</span>
<a name="l12680"><span class="ln">12680 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Loser.’ The crowd swallows them.</span>
<a name="l12681"><span class="ln">12681 </span></a><span class="s0">Grady lays a hand on Sam and Moxie’s shoulders.</span>
<a name="l12682"><span class="ln">12682 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m nineteen, not ninety.</span>
<a name="l12683"><span class="ln">12683 </span></a><span class="s0">And all my old school friends still come.</span>
<a name="l12684"><span class="ln">12684 </span></a><span class="s0">Also Isla’s here.’ He clears his throat.</span>
<a name="l12685"><span class="ln">12685 </span></a><span class="s0">‘So no drinking.’ ‘Obviously.’ Moxie folds her arms.</span>
<a name="l12686"><span class="ln">12686 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t wander off someplace dark.’ Grady shudders.</span>
<a name="l12687"><span class="ln">12687 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ha,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l12688"><span class="ln">12688 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie slips her hand into his.</span>
<a name="l12689"><span class="ln">12689 </span></a><span class="s0">‘This rule I can do.</span>
<a name="l12690"><span class="ln">12690 </span></a><span class="s0">But seriously, are you OK, Sam?</span>
<a name="l12691"><span class="ln">12691 </span></a><span class="s0">You do look peaky.’ Oh, totally fine.</span>
<a name="l12692"><span class="ln">12692 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m fine.’ He is not fine.</span>
<a name="l12693"><span class="ln">12693 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s about to lose everything.</span>
<a name="l12694"><span class="ln">12694 </span></a><span class="s0">He is not fine.</span>
<a name="l12695"><span class="ln">12695 </span></a><span class="s0">‘That’s his girlfriend, Isla,’ Moxie says.</span>
<a name="l12696"><span class="ln">12696 </span></a><span class="s0">She’s super gorgeous too.</span>
<a name="l12697"><span class="ln">12697 </span></a><span class="s0">Obviously has no standards.</span>
<a name="l12698"><span class="ln">12698 </span></a><span class="s0">Anyway.’ She nudges Sam with her hip.</span>
<a name="l12699"><span class="ln">12699 </span></a><span class="s0">People shout Moxie’s name and compliment her dress.</span>
<a name="l12700"><span class="ln">12700 </span></a><span class="s0">Quite a few are barefoot.</span>
<a name="l12701"><span class="ln">12701 </span></a><span class="s0">Quite a few are drunk.</span>
<a name="l12702"><span class="ln">12702 </span></a><span class="s0">Absolutely no one is dressed like Moxie and Sam.</span>
<a name="l12703"><span class="ln">12703 </span></a><span class="s0">Absolutely everyone keeps looking at them.</span>
<a name="l12704"><span class="ln">12704 </span></a><span class="s0">Behind his back.</span>
<a name="l12705"><span class="ln">12705 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hi,’ says Sam.</span>
<a name="l12706"><span class="ln">12706 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s confirmed,’ Kirby says.</span>
<a name="l12707"><span class="ln">12707 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And he helped me sew.</span>
<a name="l12708"><span class="ln">12708 </span></a><span class="s0">He did quite a lot actually.’ ‘Keep him,’ Kirby says.</span>
<a name="l12709"><span class="ln">12709 </span></a><span class="s0">Her cheeks flush and she talks fifty miles a minute.</span>
<a name="l12710"><span class="ln">12710 </span></a><span class="s0">This happyMoxie is a sparkling explosion of life.</span>
<a name="l12711"><span class="ln">12711 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam steps back a little.</span>
<a name="l12712"><span class="ln">12712 </span></a><span class="s0">It scares him.</span>
<a name="l12713"><span class="ln">12713 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re not marks and he’s not stealing.</span>
<a name="l12714"><span class="ln">12714 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t fit here.</span>
<a name="l12715"><span class="ln">12715 </span></a><span class="s0">Take me home.</span>
<a name="l12716"><span class="ln">12716 </span></a><span class="s0">Firelight dances in her eyes.</span>
<a name="l12717"><span class="ln">12717 </span></a><span class="s0">They definitely don’t look ready to go.</span>
<a name="l12718"><span class="ln">12718 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m fine.’ He tries to smile.</span>
<a name="l12719"><span class="ln">12719 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sad-eyed?’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l12720"><span class="ln">12720 </span></a><span class="s0">Just a little.</span>
<a name="l12721"><span class="ln">12721 </span></a><span class="s0">She smiles at that.</span>
<a name="l12722"><span class="ln">12722 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dance with me.</span>
<a name="l12723"><span class="ln">12723 </span></a><span class="s0">Music punches out of the speakers.</span>
<a name="l12724"><span class="ln">12724 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie is all twirling arms and spinning rainbow skirt.</span>
<a name="l12725"><span class="ln">12725 </span></a><span class="s0">She catches Sam’s hands and he whirls her around.</span>
<a name="l12726"><span class="ln">12726 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t dance.</span>
<a name="l12727"><span class="ln">12727 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s all elbows and knees.</span>
<a name="l12728"><span class="ln">12728 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t care.</span>
<a name="l12729"><span class="ln">12729 </span></a><span class="s0">Let him embarrass himself.</span>
<a name="l12730"><span class="ln">12730 </span></a><span class="s0">Just so long as he’s with Moxie.</span>
<a name="l12731"><span class="ln">12731 </span></a><span class="s0">The song ends and Moxie collapses against him.</span>
<a name="l12732"><span class="ln">12732 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Permanently,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l12733"><span class="ln">12733 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Thanks for that, by the way.’ ‘You’re welcome.</span>
<a name="l12734"><span class="ln">12734 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like the entire night sings goodbye.</span>
<a name="l12735"><span class="ln">12735 </span></a><span class="s0">He runs his thumb over her bottom lip.</span>
<a name="l12736"><span class="ln">12736 </span></a><span class="s0">He kisses her.</span>
<a name="l12737"><span class="ln">12737 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam will hold her.</span>
<a name="l12738"><span class="ln">12738 </span></a><span class="s0">It’ll all be fine.</span>
<a name="l12739"><span class="ln">12739 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie sighs into his shoulder.</span>
<a name="l12740"><span class="ln">12740 </span></a><span class="s0">Kirby is jogging towards them, face pinched.</span>
<a name="l12741"><span class="ln">12741 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey!’ he shouts.</span>
<a name="l12742"><span class="ln">12742 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Is that Sammy Lou?’ Sam’s hands drop away from Moxie.</span>
<a name="l12743"><span class="ln">12743 </span></a><span class="s0">The boy releases Sam’s throat.</span>
<a name="l12744"><span class="ln">12744 </span></a><span class="s0">He still can’t breathe.</span>
<a name="l12745"><span class="ln">12745 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What the hell?’ Moxie snaps.</span>
<a name="l12746"><span class="ln">12746 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t touch him.</span>
<a name="l12747"><span class="ln">12747 </span></a><span class="s0">Who are you?’ Kirby arrives, breathless.</span>
<a name="l12748"><span class="ln">12748 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Um, OK, whoa.</span>
<a name="l12749"><span class="ln">12749 </span></a><span class="s0">Let’s calm down.</span>
<a name="l12750"><span class="ln">12750 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie, this is Griffin.</span>
<a name="l12751"><span class="ln">12751 </span></a><span class="s0">Erm, Griffin … Moxie.</span>
<a name="l12752"><span class="ln">12752 </span></a><span class="s0">Or maybe it’s the ocean.</span>
<a name="l12753"><span class="ln">12753 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t quite hear through the roar.</span>
<a name="l12754"><span class="ln">12754 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t quite see.</span>
<a name="l12755"><span class="ln">12755 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs to get out of here.</span>
<a name="l12756"><span class="ln">12756 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You want to explain yourself?</span>
<a name="l12757"><span class="ln">12757 </span></a><span class="s0">Or do I just start yelling for my brothers?</span>
<a name="l12758"><span class="ln">12758 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s stomach knots.</span>
<a name="l12759"><span class="ln">12759 </span></a><span class="s0">‘They go to that public school on the south side.</span>
<a name="l12760"><span class="ln">12760 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And don’t talk like that about his brother.</span>
<a name="l12761"><span class="ln">12761 </span></a><span class="s0">She doesn’t even know Avery.</span>
<a name="l12762"><span class="ln">12762 </span></a><span class="s0">This is the Moxie he loves.</span>
<a name="l12763"><span class="ln">12763 </span></a><span class="s0">Griffin barely glances at her.</span>
<a name="l12764"><span class="ln">12764 </span></a><span class="s0">West is in so much therapy now.</span>
<a name="l12765"><span class="ln">12765 </span></a><span class="s0">You know who this kid is?</span>
<a name="l12766"><span class="ln">12766 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s a raging psychopath.’ Sam looks at his hands.</span>
<a name="l12767"><span class="ln">12767 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery was screaming.</span>
<a name="l12768"><span class="ln">12768 </span></a><span class="s0">Those stupid, goddamn bullies.</span>
<a name="l12769"><span class="ln">12769 </span></a><span class="s0">That’ll stop you twitching.</span>
<a name="l12770"><span class="ln">12770 </span></a><span class="s0">All because Avery thought they were his friends.</span>
<a name="l12771"><span class="ln">12771 </span></a><span class="s0">They strung him along and then cut him down.</span>
<a name="l12772"><span class="ln">12772 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam was going to kill them.</span>
<a name="l12773"><span class="ln">12773 </span></a><span class="s0">He was going to kill them all.</span>
<a name="l12774"><span class="ln">12774 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie turns to Sam.</span>
<a name="l12775"><span class="ln">12775 </span></a><span class="s0">Her face is closed, unreadable, eyes obsidian in the dark.</span>
<a name="l12776"><span class="ln">12776 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll get your brothers, Moxie.’ She runs off.</span>
<a name="l12777"><span class="ln">12777 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You should be in jail!’ Griffin shouts.</span>
<a name="l12778"><span class="ln">12778 </span></a><span class="s0">People are gathering now.</span>
<a name="l12779"><span class="ln">12779 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Call the cops.’ ‘No!’ Moxie cries.</span>
<a name="l12780"><span class="ln">12780 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What else do I need to say?’ Griffin snaps.</span>
<a name="l12781"><span class="ln">12781 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam drops to his knees.</span>
<a name="l12782"><span class="ln">12782 </span></a><span class="s0">Air explodes out of his lungs and doesn’t come back.</span>
<a name="l12783"><span class="ln">12783 </span></a><span class="s0">Yells collide and someone calls out frantically for Moxie.</span>
<a name="l12784"><span class="ln">12784 </span></a><span class="s0">The knot of people tightens.</span>
<a name="l12785"><span class="ln">12785 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam holds his stomach.</span>
<a name="l12786"><span class="ln">12786 </span></a><span class="s0">He tastes tears.</span>
<a name="l12787"><span class="ln">12787 </span></a><span class="s0">Why didn’t you run?</span>
<a name="l12788"><span class="ln">12788 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t you dare hit him,’ she shouts.</span>
<a name="l12789"><span class="ln">12789 </span></a><span class="s0">Griffin staggers a few steps and then spins on Moxie.</span>
<a name="l12790"><span class="ln">12790 </span></a><span class="s0">Hands shoot out.</span>
<a name="l12791"><span class="ln">12791 </span></a><span class="s0">Snatch at shirts.</span>
<a name="l12792"><span class="ln">12792 </span></a><span class="s0">Stop is whispered.</span>
<a name="l12793"><span class="ln">12793 </span></a><span class="s0">She gives the smallest cry.</span>
<a name="l12794"><span class="ln">12794 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s world speeds up.</span>
<a name="l12795"><span class="ln">12795 </span></a><span class="s0">You do not touch Moxie.</span>
<a name="l12796"><span class="ln">12796 </span></a><span class="s0">You do not ever ever ever touch Moxie.</span>
<a name="l12797"><span class="ln">12797 </span></a><span class="s0">To do what they know best.</span>
<a name="l12798"><span class="ln">12798 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t think.</span>
<a name="l12799"><span class="ln">12799 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to stop.</span>
<a name="l12800"><span class="ln">12800 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s sand in his mouth, in his eyes.</span>
<a name="l12801"><span class="ln">12801 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam tries to breathe but he hasn’t lungs any more.</span>
<a name="l12802"><span class="ln">12802 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam jerks away.</span>
<a name="l12803"><span class="ln">12803 </span></a><span class="s0">Griffin holds his broken nose and roars.</span>
<a name="l12804"><span class="ln">12804 </span></a><span class="s0">Their faces blur and spin before him.</span>
<a name="l12805"><span class="ln">12805 </span></a><span class="s0">They are red teeth and burned-out eyes.</span>
<a name="l12806"><span class="ln">12806 </span></a><span class="s0">They are horror and disgust and rage.</span>

<a name="l12808"><span class="ln">12808 </span></a><span class="s0">Just like he was so scared of his father.</span>
<a name="l12809"><span class="ln">12809 </span></a><span class="s0">Only one girl doesn’t move.</span>
<a name="l12810"><span class="ln">12810 </span></a><span class="s0">He runs past her.</span>
<a name="l12811"><span class="ln">12811 </span></a><span class="s0">Run, just run.</span>
<a name="l12812"><span class="ln">12812 </span></a><span class="s0">Just run for ever.</span>
<a name="l12813"><span class="ln">12813 </span></a><span class="s0">It hurts and he’s glad.</span>
<a name="l12814"><span class="ln">12814 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so glad.</span>
<a name="l12815"><span class="ln">12815 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants to hurt.</span>
<a name="l12816"><span class="ln">12816 </span></a><span class="s0">He deserves it.</span>
<a name="l12817"><span class="ln">12817 </span></a><span class="s0">You despicable boy, his aunt said.</span>
<a name="l12818"><span class="ln">12818 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re all right.</span>
<a name="l12819"><span class="ln">12819 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s just like his father.</span>
<a name="l12820"><span class="ln">12820 </span></a><span class="s0">He should be in prison.</span>
<a name="l12821"><span class="ln">12821 </span></a><span class="s0">He picks himself up and runs down the road.</span>
<a name="l12822"><span class="ln">12822 </span></a><span class="s0">He pulls out Avery’s phone.</span>
<a name="l12823"><span class="ln">12823 </span></a><span class="s0">Fix all your problems.</span>
<a name="l12824"><span class="ln">12824 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Vin?’ He’s crying.</span>
<a name="l12825"><span class="ln">12825 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Vin, let me talk to Avery.</span>
<a name="l12826"><span class="ln">12826 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Avery’s busy right now.’ No.</span>
<a name="l12827"><span class="ln">12827 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Please, d-don’t do this.</span>
<a name="l12828"><span class="ln">12828 </span></a><span class="s0">I need him.</span>
<a name="l12829"><span class="ln">12829 </span></a><span class="s0">I need him.’ ‘OK, OK, calm down, kid.</span>
<a name="l12830"><span class="ln">12830 </span></a><span class="s0">I can barely understand you.</span>
<a name="l12831"><span class="ln">12831 </span></a><span class="s0">What happened?’ ‘I h-h-hit … I just h-hit—’ Sam shatters.</span>
<a name="l12832"><span class="ln">12832 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s sobbing now, the phone slipping against his cheek.</span>
<a name="l12833"><span class="ln">12833 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Tell me where you are.</span>
<a name="l12834"><span class="ln">12834 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll come get you.’ ‘I want Avery.</span>
<a name="l12835"><span class="ln">12835 </span></a><span class="s0">Please, I w-want Avery.’ ‘I’ll get him for you, kid.</span>
<a name="l12836"><span class="ln">12836 </span></a><span class="s0">Just hold on.’ It’s an impossible command.</span>
<a name="l12837"><span class="ln">12837 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam has nothing left to hold on to.</span>
<a name="l12838"><span class="ln">12838 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam covers his face.</span>
<a name="l12839"><span class="ln">12839 </span></a><span class="s0">The driver’s door pops open and Vin gets out.</span>
<a name="l12840"><span class="ln">12840 </span></a><span class="s0">Tips Sam’s chin up.</span>
<a name="l12841"><span class="ln">12841 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s blood on his hands.</span>
<a name="l12842"><span class="ln">12842 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Is it yours?’ she says.</span>
<a name="l12843"><span class="ln">12843 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam shakes his head.</span>
<a name="l12844"><span class="ln">12844 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s hollowed out.</span>
<a name="l12845"><span class="ln">12845 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin hauls Sam to his feet.</span>
<a name="l12846"><span class="ln">12846 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin gets in and revs the engine.</span>
<a name="l12847"><span class="ln">12847 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Eat.’ Sam turns his head away.</span>
<a name="l12848"><span class="ln">12848 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m not messing about, kid.</span>
<a name="l12849"><span class="ln">12849 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m going to be sick.’ ‘No, you’re not.</span>
<a name="l12850"><span class="ln">12850 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re taking a bite.</span>
<a name="l12851"><span class="ln">12851 </span></a><span class="s0">Go.’ She revs the engine again.</span>
<a name="l12852"><span class="ln">12852 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I don’t want to hang around here.</span>
<a name="l12853"><span class="ln">12853 </span></a><span class="s0">Do you?’ Sam takes a bite.</span>
<a name="l12854"><span class="ln">12854 </span></a><span class="s0">He tastes blood and no chocolate at all.</span>
<a name="l12855"><span class="ln">12855 </span></a><span class="s0">She doesn’t comment.</span>
<a name="l12856"><span class="ln">12856 </span></a><span class="s0">Chocolate melts and smears on Sam’s fingers.</span>
<a name="l12857"><span class="ln">12857 </span></a><span class="s0">He wipes it on his jeans.</span>
<a name="l12858"><span class="ln">12858 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks at his waistcoat, Moxie’s amazing, detailed work.</span>
<a name="l12859"><span class="ln">12859 </span></a><span class="s0">Bloodstains stare back.</span>
<a name="l12860"><span class="ln">12860 </span></a><span class="s0">‘So Avery’s working,’ Vin says finally.</span>
<a name="l12861"><span class="ln">12861 </span></a><span class="s0">Chocolate help?’ Sam didn’t taste it.</span>
<a name="l12862"><span class="ln">12862 </span></a><span class="s0">But he’s not shaking any more.</span>
<a name="l12863"><span class="ln">12863 </span></a><span class="s0">He leans his head against the window.</span>
<a name="l12864"><span class="ln">12864 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can’t … please.</span>
<a name="l12865"><span class="ln">12865 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll sort it all out, you hear me?</span>
<a name="l12866"><span class="ln">12866 </span></a><span class="s0">The sob comes out unbidden.</span>
<a name="l12867"><span class="ln">12867 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam presses his arm over his mouth.</span>
<a name="l12868"><span class="ln">12868 </span></a><span class="s0">How much goes away?</span>
<a name="l12869"><span class="ln">12869 </span></a><span class="s0">The whole summer?</span>
<a name="l12870"><span class="ln">12870 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing else.’ Vin spins the steering wheel.</span>
<a name="l12871"><span class="ln">12871 </span></a><span class="s0">Streetlights flash in Sam’s eyes.</span>
<a name="l12872"><span class="ln">12872 </span></a><span class="s0">She pulls up and shuts off the engine.</span>
<a name="l12873"><span class="ln">12873 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can’t,’ Sam whispers.</span>
<a name="l12874"><span class="ln">12874 </span></a><span class="s0">Can he even walk right now?</span>
<a name="l12875"><span class="ln">12875 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You do it, or I throw you to the cops.</span>
<a name="l12876"><span class="ln">12876 </span></a><span class="s0">Help me and I fix everything.</span>
<a name="l12877"><span class="ln">12877 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s not a decision.’ Sam swallows.</span>
<a name="l12878"><span class="ln">12878 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Get out of the car,’ Vin says.</span>
<a name="l12879"><span class="ln">12879 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam gets out of the car.</span>
<a name="l12880"><span class="ln">12880 </span></a><span class="s0">They walk three blocks.</span>
<a name="l12881"><span class="ln">12881 </span></a><span class="s0">She has a black duffle bag slung over a shoulder.</span>
<a name="l12882"><span class="ln">12882 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam has to admit – Vin knows what she’s doing.</span>
<a name="l12883"><span class="ln">12883 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s a sense of safety in that.</span>
<a name="l12884"><span class="ln">12884 </span></a><span class="s0">This is why Avery keeps working for her, isn’t it?</span>
<a name="l12885"><span class="ln">12885 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants to be safe, same as Sam.</span>
<a name="l12886"><span class="ln">12886 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t want to be like this.</span>
<a name="l12887"><span class="ln">12887 </span></a><span class="s0">He focuses on Vin’s heeled boots.</span>
<a name="l12888"><span class="ln">12888 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam has no idea what time it is.</span>
<a name="l12889"><span class="ln">12889 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What is this place?’ His voice is low.</span>
<a name="l12890"><span class="ln">12890 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I have a contact overseas.</span>
<a name="l12891"><span class="ln">12891 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s an easy ten grand.’ ‘Ten grand?’ Sam stares.</span>
<a name="l12892"><span class="ln">12892 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin’s red lips twitch.</span>
<a name="l12893"><span class="ln">12893 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You get a cut, little angel.</span>
<a name="l12894"><span class="ln">12894 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery says you’re obsessed with having a house.</span>
<a name="l12895"><span class="ln">12895 </span></a><span class="s0">We can work something out.</span>
<a name="l12896"><span class="ln">12896 </span></a><span class="s0">If you stay on.</span>
<a name="l12897"><span class="ln">12897 </span></a><span class="s0">Keep working for me.’ Sam shifts his gaze away.</span>
<a name="l12898"><span class="ln">12898 </span></a><span class="s0">He wouldn’t – he can’t— He doesn’t want this.</span>
<a name="l12899"><span class="ln">12899 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t want to admit he would fit.</span>
<a name="l12900"><span class="ln">12900 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants to forget what he’s good at.</span>
<a name="l12901"><span class="ln">12901 </span></a><span class="s0">Fists and theft.</span>
<a name="l12902"><span class="ln">12902 </span></a><span class="s0">‘See that window?</span>
<a name="l12903"><span class="ln">12903 </span></a><span class="s0">So they could fly.</span>
<a name="l12904"><span class="ln">12904 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery shouldn’t tell stuff like that.</span>
<a name="l12905"><span class="ln">12905 </span></a><span class="s0">It belongs to him and Sam.</span>
<a name="l12906"><span class="ln">12906 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can.’ Sam’s mouth is dry.</span>
<a name="l12907"><span class="ln">12907 </span></a><span class="s0">She gives him a pair of thin gloves.</span>
<a name="l12908"><span class="ln">12908 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s not cold.</span>
<a name="l12909"><span class="ln">12909 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You just flip the off switch,’ she says.</span>
<a name="l12910"><span class="ln">12910 </span></a><span class="s0">Then unlock the back door.</span>
<a name="l12911"><span class="ln">12911 </span></a><span class="s0">Use your phone for light.</span>
<a name="l12912"><span class="ln">12912 </span></a><span class="s0">Easy, kid, so easy.</span>
<a name="l12913"><span class="ln">12913 </span></a><span class="s0">She tugs out her phone and frowns at the screen.</span>
<a name="l12914"><span class="ln">12914 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’ll take this.</span>
<a name="l12915"><span class="ln">12915 </span></a><span class="s0">You got it?’ Sam nods.</span>
<a name="l12916"><span class="ln">12916 </span></a><span class="s0">Even Sam winces.</span>
<a name="l12917"><span class="ln">12917 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t think about it now, Sammy.</span>
<a name="l12918"><span class="ln">12918 </span></a><span class="s0">Take a breath.</span>
<a name="l12919"><span class="ln">12919 </span></a><span class="s0">The building is tall and the window looks impossibly tiny.</span>
<a name="l12920"><span class="ln">12920 </span></a><span class="s0">He glances back.</span>
<a name="l12921"><span class="ln">12921 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin makes an angry flicking motion.</span>
<a name="l12922"><span class="ln">12922 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers crawl across bricks.</span>
<a name="l12923"><span class="ln">12923 </span></a><span class="s0">It shudders under his weight, but he just moves faster.</span>
<a name="l12924"><span class="ln">12924 </span></a><span class="s0">Fast, boy, go fast.</span>
<a name="l12925"><span class="ln">12925 </span></a><span class="s0">His heart crashes hard in his chest.</span>
<a name="l12926"><span class="ln">12926 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t look down.</span>
<a name="l12927"><span class="ln">12927 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t look for Vin.</span>
<a name="l12928"><span class="ln">12928 </span></a><span class="s0">After this, he gets Avery.</span>
<a name="l12929"><span class="ln">12929 </span></a><span class="s0">He gets to hide.</span>
<a name="l12930"><span class="ln">12930 </span></a><span class="s0">It crashes to the floor inside.</span>
<a name="l12931"><span class="ln">12931 </span></a><span class="s0">The sound is an explosion over the empty car park.</span>
<a name="l12932"><span class="ln">12932 </span></a><span class="s0">He can’t see Vin.</span>
<a name="l12933"><span class="ln">12933 </span></a><span class="s0">His shoulders only just wedge through.</span>
<a name="l12934"><span class="ln">12934 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t think about falling.</span>
<a name="l12935"><span class="ln">12935 </span></a><span class="s0">He flips down, silent as death.</span>
<a name="l12936"><span class="ln">12936 </span></a><span class="s0">He walks the halls.</span>
<a name="l12937"><span class="ln">12937 </span></a><span class="s0">Avoids the cameras.</span>
<a name="l12938"><span class="ln">12938 </span></a><span class="s0">Gets to the back door.</span>
<a name="l12939"><span class="ln">12939 </span></a><span class="s0">He shuts down the light, the camera, the alarms.</span>
<a name="l12940"><span class="ln">12940 </span></a><span class="s0">Once he unlocks that door, this place is Vin’s.</span>
<a name="l12941"><span class="ln">12941 </span></a><span class="s0">This is real and it’s big.</span>
<a name="l12942"><span class="ln">12942 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers are red, a poisoned stain.</span>
<a name="l12943"><span class="ln">12943 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie screams ‘Sam’ in his ears.</span>
<a name="l12944"><span class="ln">12944 </span></a><span class="s0">Not angry – frightened, desperate.</span>
<a name="l12945"><span class="ln">12945 </span></a><span class="s0">He feels hot.</span>
<a name="l12946"><span class="ln">12946 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s going to throw up.</span>
<a name="l12947"><span class="ln">12947 </span></a><span class="s0">He slides down the wall, holding his face.</span>
<a name="l12948"><span class="ln">12948 </span></a><span class="s0">Tears spill between his fingers.</span>
<a name="l12949"><span class="ln">12949 </span></a><span class="s0">If he does this, it’s the beginning, not the end.</span>
<a name="l12950"><span class="ln">12950 </span></a><span class="s0">And he will never see Moxie again.</span>
<a name="l12951"><span class="ln">12951 </span></a><span class="s0">He did that himself.</span>
<a name="l12952"><span class="ln">12952 </span></a><span class="s0">The doorknob jiggles and then there’s an urgent hiss.</span>
<a name="l12953"><span class="ln">12953 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sammy.’ Sam hugs his legs tighter.</span>
<a name="l12954"><span class="ln">12954 </span></a><span class="s0">Are you there?</span>
<a name="l12955"><span class="ln">12955 </span></a><span class="s0">Won’t do it.</span>
<a name="l12956"><span class="ln">12956 </span></a><span class="s0">Can’t can’t can’t— The doorknob rattles again and Vin swears.</span>
<a name="l12957"><span class="ln">12957 </span></a><span class="s0">Open – this – door.’ Sam hits dial.</span>
<a name="l12958"><span class="ln">12958 </span></a><span class="s0">Emergency picks up.</span>
<a name="l12959"><span class="ln">12959 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Please,’ Sam whispers, giving the address of the art gallery.</span>
<a name="l12960"><span class="ln">12960 </span></a><span class="s0">‘It’s being robbed.</span>
<a name="l12961"><span class="ln">12961 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s out of time.</span>
<a name="l12962"><span class="ln">12962 </span></a><span class="s0">‘She’s going to kill me.’ He ends the call.</span>
<a name="l12963"><span class="ln">12963 </span></a><span class="s0">More than one set.</span>
<a name="l12964"><span class="ln">12964 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s heart skips a beat.</span>
<a name="l12965"><span class="ln">12965 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin’s is acid.</span>
<a name="l12966"><span class="ln">12966 </span></a><span class="s0">I had to come!</span>
<a name="l12967"><span class="ln">12967 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery can’t be here.</span>
<a name="l12968"><span class="ln">12968 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam just called the goddamn police.</span>
<a name="l12969"><span class="ln">12969 </span></a><span class="s0">He isn’t thinking.</span>
<a name="l12970"><span class="ln">12970 </span></a><span class="s0">Just let there have never been a Sammy Lou.</span>
<a name="l12971"><span class="ln">12971 </span></a><span class="s0">He leans his cheek against the cold door.</span>
<a name="l12972"><span class="ln">12972 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to get Avery out of here.</span>
<a name="l12973"><span class="ln">12973 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing else matters.</span>
<a name="l12974"><span class="ln">12974 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam flips the lock.</span>
<a name="l12975"><span class="ln">12975 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery’s voice is high and trembling.</span>
<a name="l12976"><span class="ln">12976 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Who would know—’ ‘The kid,’ Vin snaps.</span>
<a name="l12977"><span class="ln">12977 </span></a><span class="s0">‘The kid has a phone.</span>
<a name="l12978"><span class="ln">12978 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam doesn’t stop.</span>
<a name="l12979"><span class="ln">12979 </span></a><span class="s0">Blue and red lights flash on the street.</span>
<a name="l12980"><span class="ln">12980 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Run!’ Vin gasps and pelts after Sam.</span>
<a name="l12981"><span class="ln">12981 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s a brief hesitation and then Avery takes off too.</span>
<a name="l12982"><span class="ln">12982 </span></a><span class="s0">They pound after him.</span>
<a name="l12983"><span class="ln">12983 </span></a><span class="s0">Chasing him or just getting away?</span>
<a name="l12984"><span class="ln">12984 </span></a><span class="s0">His lungs scream.</span>
<a name="l12985"><span class="ln">12985 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam hits the ground and keeps running.</span>
<a name="l12986"><span class="ln">12986 </span></a><span class="s0">But Avery trips.</span>
<a name="l12987"><span class="ln">12987 </span></a><span class="s0">And then Vin is on top of him.</span>

<a name="l12995"><span class="ln">12995 </span></a><span class="s0">He sags to his knees, hands to his head.</span>
<a name="l12996"><span class="ln">12996 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin picks something up from the piles of alley rubbish.</span>
<a name="l12997"><span class="ln">12997 </span></a><span class="s0">A broken piece of plywood spiked with bent rusted nails.</span>
<a name="l12998"><span class="ln">12998 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery scrabbles to get up.</span>
<a name="l12999"><span class="ln">12999 </span></a><span class="s0">I-I-I—’ Vin cracks the pole across Avery’s stomach.</span>
<a name="l13000"><span class="ln">13000 </span></a><span class="s0">He falls back down with a cry.</span>

<a name="l13003"><span class="ln">13003 </span></a><span class="s0">It catches Avery across the shoulder blades with sickening thwack.</span>
<a name="l13004"><span class="ln">13004 </span></a><span class="s0">He never runs.</span>
<a name="l13005"><span class="ln">13005 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam leaps forward.</span>

<a name="l13016"><span class="ln">13016 </span></a><span class="s0">His world shudders.</span>
<a name="l13017"><span class="ln">13017 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks down.</span>

<a name="l13028"><span class="ln">13028 </span></a><span class="s0">So much of it.</span>
<a name="l13029"><span class="ln">13029 </span></a><span class="s0">It doesn’t really hurt.</span>

<a name="l13034"><span class="ln">13034 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Avery.’ Sam’s fist curls in Avery’s shirt.</span>
<a name="l13035"><span class="ln">13035 </span></a><span class="s0">The alley is quiet.</span>
<a name="l13036"><span class="ln">13036 </span></a><span class="s0">Vin is gone.</span>
<a name="l13037"><span class="ln">13037 </span></a><span class="s0">His stims get tangled when he’s upset.</span>

<a name="l13039"><span class="ln">13039 </span></a><span class="s0">No one hears.</span>
<a name="l13040"><span class="ln">13040 </span></a><span class="s0">No one comes.</span>
<a name="l13041"><span class="ln">13041 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam tries to cough but it hurts too much.</span>
<a name="l13042"><span class="ln">13042 </span></a><span class="s0">The pain is here, finally.</span>

<a name="l13046"><span class="ln">13046 </span></a><span class="s0">Then it’s quiet.</span>
<a name="l13047"><span class="ln">13047 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam tries to put the pieces of himself together.</span>
<a name="l13048"><span class="ln">13048 </span></a><span class="s0">Tries, with cotton and screws and wishes.</span>
<a name="l13049"><span class="ln">13049 </span></a><span class="s0">But doesn’t he deserve this?</span>
<a name="l13050"><span class="ln">13050 </span></a><span class="s0">His ribs folds inwards as everything inside him shudders.</span>
<a name="l13051"><span class="ln">13051 </span></a><span class="s0">The boy turns invisible.</span>
<a name="l13052"><span class="ln">13052 </span></a><span class="s0">As he should be.</span>
<a name="l13053"><span class="ln">13053 </span></a><span class="s0">They try to pry his fingers open.</span>
<a name="l13054"><span class="ln">13054 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s too weak to stop them.</span>
<a name="l13055"><span class="ln">13055 </span></a><span class="s0">‘No, wait!’ Avery’s voice is panicked, words tripping over themselves.</span>
<a name="l13056"><span class="ln">13056 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Don’t take it.</span>
<a name="l13057"><span class="ln">13057 </span></a><span class="s0">We’ve got this.</span>
<a name="l13058"><span class="ln">13058 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs it!</span>
<a name="l13059"><span class="ln">13059 </span></a><span class="s0">Listen to me, listen, just—’ They leave Sam’s fingers alone.</span>
<a name="l13060"><span class="ln">13060 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What’s he holding anyway?’ ‘A key.</span>
<a name="l13061"><span class="ln">13061 </span></a><span class="s0">They need to understand the key.</span>
<a name="l13062"><span class="ln">13062 </span></a><span class="s0">If lost, please return to the De Laineys.</span>
<a name="l13063"><span class="ln">13063 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy is fourteen and full of broken pieces.</span>
<a name="l13064"><span class="ln">13064 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s been here for a long time.</span>
<a name="l13065"><span class="ln">13065 </span></a><span class="s0">If he goes in, she’ll call the cops.</span>
<a name="l13066"><span class="ln">13066 </span></a><span class="s0">After what he did to those boys at school.</span>
<a name="l13067"><span class="ln">13067 </span></a><span class="s0">Or maybe that’s the wind.</span>
<a name="l13068"><span class="ln">13068 </span></a><span class="s0">Or maybe that’s him.</span>
<a name="l13069"><span class="ln">13069 </span></a><span class="s0">Being smashed to pieces.</span>
<a name="l13070"><span class="ln">13070 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood and broken bone and hollowed-out eyes.</span>
<a name="l13071"><span class="ln">13071 </span></a><span class="s0">And the screaming.</span>
<a name="l13072"><span class="ln">13072 </span></a><span class="s0">When they catch Sammy, they’ll take him away.</span>
<a name="l13073"><span class="ln">13073 </span></a><span class="s0">He deserves it.</span>
<a name="l13074"><span class="ln">13074 </span></a><span class="s0">He always goes too far.</span>
<a name="l13075"><span class="ln">13075 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll die in prison.</span>
<a name="l13076"><span class="ln">13076 </span></a><span class="s0">He’ll die without Avery.</span>
<a name="l13077"><span class="ln">13077 </span></a><span class="s0">The curtain rips back and Avery’s there, eyes melting pools.</span>
<a name="l13078"><span class="ln">13078 </span></a><span class="s0">‘C-c-can you get my jumper?’ Sammy whispers.</span>
<a name="l13079"><span class="ln">13079 </span></a><span class="s0">The curtain falls and there’s a brief scuffling.</span>
<a name="l13080"><span class="ln">13080 </span></a><span class="s0">‘If Sammy’s there, I’m calling the cops!’ she shouts.</span>
<a name="l13081"><span class="ln">13081 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Come back inside, Avery.</span>
<a name="l13082"><span class="ln">13082 </span></a><span class="s0">You’ll get your cast wet.</span>
<a name="l13083"><span class="ln">13083 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sammy.’ It’s a sob.</span>
<a name="l13084"><span class="ln">13084 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey.’ Sam clutches him, a drowning boy.</span>
<a name="l13085"><span class="ln">13085 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Hey – h-hey, you’ll get your cast wet.</span>
<a name="l13086"><span class="ln">13086 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s only just out of hospital.</span>
<a name="l13087"><span class="ln">13087 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can’t.’ Sam glances desperately at the door.</span>
<a name="l13088"><span class="ln">13088 </span></a><span class="s0">Has she called the cops already?</span>
<a name="l13089"><span class="ln">13089 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m going to … I’m running away.’ ‘OK,’ Avery says.</span>

<a name="l13092"><span class="ln">13092 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll steal houses.</span>
<a name="l13093"><span class="ln">13093 </span></a><span class="s0">Tears and rain.</span>
<a name="l13094"><span class="ln">13094 </span></a><span class="s0">And me,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l13095"><span class="ln">13095 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We.’ He’s too soft, they always said.</span>
<a name="l13096"><span class="ln">13096 </span></a><span class="s0">He shifts on the pillows, his eyelids swollen and sticky.</span>
<a name="l13097"><span class="ln">13097 </span></a><span class="s0">A chair scrapes.</span>
<a name="l13098"><span class="ln">13098 </span></a><span class="s0">Sheets rustle as elbows leans forward.</span>
<a name="l13099"><span class="ln">13099 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers fold over it automatically.</span>
<a name="l13100"><span class="ln">13100 </span></a><span class="s0">‘They took it off you during surgery.</span>

<a name="l13102"><span class="ln">13102 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s OK, Sammy.’ Sam drags his eyes open.</span>
<a name="l13103"><span class="ln">13103 </span></a><span class="s0">His face feels stung and swollen, his throat flayed raw.</span>
<a name="l13104"><span class="ln">13104 </span></a><span class="s0">He looks terrible.</span>
<a name="l13105"><span class="ln">13105 </span></a><span class="s0">His clothes are gone.</span>
<a name="l13106"><span class="ln">13106 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie’s waistcoat is gone.</span>
<a name="l13107"><span class="ln">13107 </span></a><span class="s0">He ruined it.</span>
<a name="l13108"><span class="ln">13108 </span></a><span class="s0">All her work.</span>
<a name="l13109"><span class="ln">13109 </span></a><span class="s0">She’ll yell at him for six days solid for— Oh.</span>
<a name="l13110"><span class="ln">13110 </span></a><span class="s0">There is no more Moxie.</span>
<a name="l13111"><span class="ln">13111 </span></a><span class="s0">There will be no more Moxie.</span>
<a name="l13112"><span class="ln">13112 </span></a><span class="s0">He wants Avery to deny it.</span>
<a name="l13113"><span class="ln">13113 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Yeah,’ says Avery, voice thick.</span>
<a name="l13114"><span class="ln">13114 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sorry, Sammy.</span>
<a name="l13115"><span class="ln">13115 </span></a><span class="s0">I-I-I had to tell them everything.’ Oh.</span>
<a name="l13116"><span class="ln">13116 </span></a><span class="s0">But he just feels numb.</span>
<a name="l13117"><span class="ln">13117 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You had stitches,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l13118"><span class="ln">13118 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But it went in deep so … surgery.</span>
<a name="l13119"><span class="ln">13119 </span></a><span class="s0">It took a while.</span>
<a name="l13120"><span class="ln">13120 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m supposed to get the nurse when you wake up.</span>

<a name="l13122"><span class="ln">13122 </span></a><span class="s0">How bad?’ Bad.</span>
<a name="l13123"><span class="ln">13123 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m OK.’ Sam closes his eyes.</span>
<a name="l13124"><span class="ln">13124 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam puts a hand on Avery’s head.</span>
<a name="l13125"><span class="ln">13125 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I don’t think so.</span>
<a name="l13126"><span class="ln">13126 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery scrubs his eyes with the hem of his T-shirt.</span>
<a name="l13127"><span class="ln">13127 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sammy, what was I supposed to do?</span>
<a name="l13128"><span class="ln">13128 </span></a><span class="s0">I couldn’t let you die.’ He’s going to jail.</span>
<a name="l13129"><span class="ln">13129 </span></a><span class="s0">A small part of his heart is glad.</span>
<a name="l13130"><span class="ln">13130 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so tired.</span>
<a name="l13131"><span class="ln">13131 </span></a><span class="s0">Sammy – I can’t.</span>
<a name="l13132"><span class="ln">13132 </span></a><span class="s0">I need you.</span>
<a name="l13133"><span class="ln">13133 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I lied when I said I didn’t.</span>

<a name="l13135"><span class="ln">13135 </span></a><span class="s0">I LIED —’ ‘Hey, hey, shh.</span>
<a name="l13136"><span class="ln">13136 </span></a><span class="s0">I know.’ Sam stretches out his fingers, brushing Avery’s wrist.</span>
<a name="l13137"><span class="ln">13137 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Have you slept?’ Avery shakes his head, whole body trembling.</span>
<a name="l13138"><span class="ln">13138 </span></a><span class="s0">‘My hands are going like a psycho,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l13139"><span class="ln">13139 </span></a><span class="s0">You need to move.</span>
<a name="l13140"><span class="ln">13140 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s OK.’ Avery whimpers.</span>
<a name="l13141"><span class="ln">13141 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Is this OK?’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l13142"><span class="ln">13142 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can move.’ ‘Don’t leave.’ ‘I’m not leaving.</span>
<a name="l13143"><span class="ln">13143 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m not leaving,’ Avery says.</span>
<a name="l13144"><span class="ln">13144 </span></a><span class="s0">The trick is to keep quiet.</span>
<a name="l13145"><span class="ln">13145 </span></a><span class="s0">The trick is to hold on to Avery.</span>
<a name="l13146"><span class="ln">13146 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s the falling.</span>
<a name="l13147"><span class="ln">13147 </span></a><span class="s0">Sometimes he can’t take a deep enough breath.</span>
<a name="l13148"><span class="ln">13148 </span></a><span class="s0">He won’t eat.</span>
<a name="l13149"><span class="ln">13149 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s been twenty-four hours, and he’s so, so sore.</span>
<a name="l13150"><span class="ln">13150 </span></a><span class="s0">It just slips back down.</span>
<a name="l13151"><span class="ln">13151 </span></a><span class="s0">They don’t want to see him as a child.</span>
<a name="l13152"><span class="ln">13152 </span></a><span class="s0">He curls tighter into a ball.</span>
<a name="l13153"><span class="ln">13153 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Excuse me, but you can’t be in here.’ Sam tenses.</span>
<a name="l13154"><span class="ln">13154 </span></a><span class="s0">‘But it says family, right?</span>
<a name="l13155"><span class="ln">13155 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m family.’ ‘Uh.</span>
<a name="l13156"><span class="ln">13156 </span></a><span class="s0">You look nothing like—’ ‘Oh, just five minutes.</span>
<a name="l13157"><span class="ln">13157 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ve run across the entire city to find him.</span>
<a name="l13158"><span class="ln">13158 </span></a><span class="s0">Let me see her.</span>
<a name="l13159"><span class="ln">13159 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s a fist to Sam’s already pulverised stomach.</span>
<a name="l13160"><span class="ln">13160 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How could you?’ He shrinks against the pillows.</span>
<a name="l13161"><span class="ln">13161 </span></a><span class="s0">‘What you did?</span>
<a name="l13162"><span class="ln">13162 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s you—’ She stops.</span>
<a name="l13163"><span class="ln">13163 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s you who’s the monster.</span>
<a name="l13164"><span class="ln">13164 </span></a><span class="s0">An ocean away.</span>

<a name="l13170"><span class="ln">13170 </span></a><span class="s0">Her voice is tight.</span>
<a name="l13171"><span class="ln">13171 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Dad said he could’ve helped.’ Too late now.</span>
<a name="l13172"><span class="ln">13172 </span></a><span class="s0">‘He couldn’t.’ Sam’s heart punches holes in his chest.</span>
<a name="l13173"><span class="ln">13173 </span></a><span class="s0">And you don’t deserve to be caught?</span>
<a name="l13174"><span class="ln">13174 </span></a><span class="s0">Look what he did.</span>
<a name="l13175"><span class="ln">13175 </span></a><span class="s0">Look at his hands.</span>
<a name="l13176"><span class="ln">13176 </span></a><span class="s0">She slips a phone from her pocket.</span>
<a name="l13177"><span class="ln">13177 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s mouth is cotton and ash.</span>
<a name="l13178"><span class="ln">13178 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Just leave it, OK?</span>
<a name="l13179"><span class="ln">13179 </span></a><span class="s0">All waif and damp eyes and fluttering fingers.</span>
<a name="l13180"><span class="ln">13180 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And your brother?’ Moxie says, stiff now.</span>
<a name="l13181"><span class="ln">13181 </span></a><span class="s0">How is he going to help you?</span>
<a name="l13182"><span class="ln">13182 </span></a><span class="s0">You said he needs help.’ He does.</span>
<a name="l13183"><span class="ln">13183 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’ll be fine.’ Sam rubs his knuckles over his eyes.</span>
<a name="l13184"><span class="ln">13184 </span></a><span class="s0">But at least she didn’t call anyone.</span>
<a name="l13185"><span class="ln">13185 </span></a><span class="s0">And then … then what even happened?’ Sam feels sick.</span>
<a name="l13186"><span class="ln">13186 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I got stabbed.’ Moxie’s eyes widen.</span>
<a name="l13187"><span class="ln">13187 </span></a><span class="s0">But she doesn’t.</span>
<a name="l13188"><span class="ln">13188 </span></a><span class="s0">By who?’ Sam closes his eyes.</span>
<a name="l13189"><span class="ln">13189 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Someone who hit Avery.’ Sam rubs his eyes again.</span>
<a name="l13190"><span class="ln">13190 </span></a><span class="s0">They keep filling up.</span>
<a name="l13191"><span class="ln">13191 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so soft.</span>
<a name="l13192"><span class="ln">13192 </span></a><span class="s0">The trick is to not be so soft.</span>
<a name="l13193"><span class="ln">13193 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sorry,’ he whispers.</span>
<a name="l13194"><span class="ln">13194 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m so so sorry.’ Moxie backhands her eyes furiously.</span>
<a name="l13195"><span class="ln">13195 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I know Griffin hit you first.</span>
<a name="l13196"><span class="ln">13196 </span></a><span class="s0">But … Sam, you scare me.’ He scares Avery too.</span>
<a name="l13197"><span class="ln">13197 </span></a><span class="s0">He scares himself.</span>
<a name="l13198"><span class="ln">13198 </span></a><span class="s0">I want to stop, he could scream.</span>

<a name="l13201"><span class="ln">13201 </span></a><span class="s0">And even then, would it be enough?</span>
<a name="l13202"><span class="ln">13202 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam’s insides turn to ice.</span>
<a name="l13203"><span class="ln">13203 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie pushes sweaty hair out of her eyes.</span>
<a name="l13204"><span class="ln">13204 </span></a><span class="s0">She turns to the social worker.</span>

<a name="l13208"><span class="ln">13208 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam gives the tiniest shake of his head.</span>
<a name="l13209"><span class="ln">13209 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam bunches his fists in the blankets.</span>
<a name="l13210"><span class="ln">13210 </span></a><span class="s0">He needs Avery.</span>
<a name="l13211"><span class="ln">13211 </span></a><span class="s0">They’re not going to let him have Avery.</span>
<a name="l13212"><span class="ln">13212 </span></a><span class="s0">The social worker holds out his hand to shake Sam’s.</span>
<a name="l13213"><span class="ln">13213 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Emery Evans,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l13214"><span class="ln">13214 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And this is your lawyer, Celia Polnik.</span>
<a name="l13215"><span class="ln">13215 </span></a><span class="s0">He has no words.</span>

<a name="l13217"><span class="ln">13217 </span></a><span class="s0">His thin chest moves raggedly.</span>
<a name="l13218"><span class="ln">13218 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe a girl woke him on her way out.</span>
<a name="l13219"><span class="ln">13219 </span></a><span class="s0">‘OK,’ Avery says, ‘OK, I’m here.</span>
<a name="l13220"><span class="ln">13220 </span></a><span class="s0">Possibly a nap.</span>
<a name="l13221"><span class="ln">13221 </span></a><span class="s0">Possibly he could never wake up.</span>
<a name="l13222"><span class="ln">13222 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers brush over the bandages taped to his stomach.</span>
<a name="l13223"><span class="ln">13223 </span></a><span class="s0">Or how often he screams himself awake at night.</span>
<a name="l13224"><span class="ln">13224 </span></a><span class="s0">No one knows what to do with him.</span>
<a name="l13225"><span class="ln">13225 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery, so far, slips through the cracks of everyone’s attention.</span>
<a name="l13226"><span class="ln">13226 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam pulls himself upright.</span>
<a name="l13227"><span class="ln">13227 </span></a><span class="s0">He seems satisfied.</span>

<a name="l13235"><span class="ln">13235 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Avery isn’t back yet,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l13236"><span class="ln">13236 </span></a><span class="s0">The man is all spider-thin fingers and a disapproving mouth.</span>

<a name="l13238"><span class="ln">13238 </span></a><span class="s0">‘We’re not waiting.’ Sam understands.</span>
<a name="l13239"><span class="ln">13239 </span></a><span class="s0">Evans did this on purpose.</span>
<a name="l13240"><span class="ln">13240 </span></a><span class="s0">When Avery’s sleeping.</span>
<a name="l13241"><span class="ln">13241 </span></a><span class="s0">When Avery’s gone to try and find Aunt Karen.</span>
<a name="l13242"><span class="ln">13242 </span></a><span class="s0">Then his spider fingers will be all over Sam’s brother.</span>
<a name="l13243"><span class="ln">13243 </span></a><span class="s0">But he doesn’t want Avery at the courthouse.</span>
<a name="l13244"><span class="ln">13244 </span></a><span class="s0">But Sam can’t go without him.</span>
<a name="l13245"><span class="ln">13245 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so empty.</span>
<a name="l13246"><span class="ln">13246 </span></a><span class="s0">Stars and buttons and caramel truffles.</span>
<a name="l13247"><span class="ln">13247 </span></a><span class="s0">Locked from the outside.</span>
<a name="l13248"><span class="ln">13248 </span></a><span class="s0">Evans’s car purrs smoothly through the city.</span>
<a name="l13249"><span class="ln">13249 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Am I going to jail?’ Sam says at last.</span>
<a name="l13250"><span class="ln">13250 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I can’t predict the judge.’ A non-answer.</span>
<a name="l13251"><span class="ln">13251 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam should be used to those.</span>
<a name="l13252"><span class="ln">13252 </span></a><span class="s0">Evans doesn’t notice.</span>

<a name="l13254"><span class="ln">13254 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s ripping apart.</span>
<a name="l13255"><span class="ln">13255 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I need air,’ he whispers.</span>
<a name="l13256"><span class="ln">13256 </span></a><span class="s0">Then louder, ‘I need the window down.</span>
<a name="l13257"><span class="ln">13257 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam unbuckles his belt and puts his whole head out.</span>
<a name="l13258"><span class="ln">13258 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sit back down,’ Evans commands.</span>
<a name="l13259"><span class="ln">13259 </span></a><span class="s0">Evans yells at his back.</span>
<a name="l13260"><span class="ln">13260 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You can’t afford to do this!’ Evan shouts.</span>
<a name="l13261"><span class="ln">13261 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam tucks his head and swerves amongst cars.</span>
<a name="l13262"><span class="ln">13262 </span></a><span class="s0">His shoes hit the sidewalk.</span>
<a name="l13263"><span class="ln">13263 </span></a><span class="s0">You have to get out of here.</span>
<a name="l13264"><span class="ln">13264 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood blooms across the white like spilt paint.</span>
<a name="l13265"><span class="ln">13265 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s good at running away.</span>
<a name="l13266"><span class="ln">13266 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like ripping stitches.</span>
<a name="l13267"><span class="ln">13267 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s like the knife going in again and again.</span>
<a name="l13268"><span class="ln">13268 </span></a><span class="s0">He throws his tie away.</span>
<a name="l13269"><span class="ln">13269 </span></a><span class="s0">His legs know the destination even before his mind does.</span>
<a name="l13270"><span class="ln">13270 </span></a><span class="s0">Walk, Sammy, just walk.</span>
<a name="l13271"><span class="ln">13271 </span></a><span class="s0">They said they would help.</span>
<a name="l13272"><span class="ln">13272 </span></a><span class="s0">The sun bathes the world in dusky blues and pinks.</span>
<a name="l13273"><span class="ln">13273 </span></a><span class="s0">He slumps into the gutter in front of the house.</span>
<a name="l13274"><span class="ln">13274 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s late enough that everyone will be home.</span>
<a name="l13275"><span class="ln">13275 </span></a><span class="s0">Jeremy is probably cooking – it’s his night, isn’t it?</span>
<a name="l13276"><span class="ln">13276 </span></a><span class="s0">Toby is probably drawing on a wall.</span>
<a name="l13277"><span class="ln">13277 </span></a><span class="s0">Grady is reading and bossing everyone around.</span>
<a name="l13278"><span class="ln">13278 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie is Moxie is Moxie is Moxie hates him.</span>
<a name="l13279"><span class="ln">13279 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam rests his face on his knees.</span>
<a name="l13280"><span class="ln">13280 </span></a><span class="s0">This house will never be his.</span>
<a name="l13281"><span class="ln">13281 </span></a><span class="s0">It tastes of cooler days and the end of summer.</span>
<a name="l13282"><span class="ln">13282 </span></a><span class="s0">It had to end.</span>
<a name="l13283"><span class="ln">13283 </span></a><span class="s0">Boots hit the footpath behind him.</span>
<a name="l13284"><span class="ln">13284 </span></a><span class="s0">He keeps his face pressed in his knees.</span>
<a name="l13285"><span class="ln">13285 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Sam.’ The voice is softness and sorrow.</span>
<a name="l13286"><span class="ln">13286 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr De Lainey drops down into the gutter beside Sam.</span>
<a name="l13287"><span class="ln">13287 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t touch him.</span>
<a name="l13288"><span class="ln">13288 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t look at his face.</span>
<a name="l13289"><span class="ln">13289 </span></a><span class="s0">He never wanted those disappointed eyes on him.</span>
<a name="l13290"><span class="ln">13290 </span></a><span class="s0">Why did Sam come back?</span>
<a name="l13291"><span class="ln">13291 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’re lying.’ Sam shrinks into himself a little further.</span>
<a name="l13292"><span class="ln">13292 </span></a><span class="s0">But Mr De Lainey’s voice isn’t angry.</span>
<a name="l13293"><span class="ln">13293 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I know you’re looking for something, Sam,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l13294"><span class="ln">13294 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I know you found it here.</span>
<a name="l13295"><span class="ln">13295 </span></a><span class="s0">‘A family.’ His voice dries in his throat.</span>
<a name="l13296"><span class="ln">13296 </span></a><span class="s0">I know I know I know.</span>
<a name="l13297"><span class="ln">13297 </span></a><span class="s0">But the gaze before him is just sad and tired.</span>
<a name="l13298"><span class="ln">13298 </span></a><span class="s0">No more hiding and running.</span>
<a name="l13299"><span class="ln">13299 </span></a><span class="s0">You need help, real help.</span>
<a name="l13300"><span class="ln">13300 </span></a><span class="s0">They stay like that for a minute or a year.</span>
<a name="l13301"><span class="ln">13301 </span></a><span class="s0">‘And then you can let me know what we’re doing.</span>
<a name="l13302"><span class="ln">13302 </span></a><span class="s0">I won’t stop you if you leave.</span>
<a name="l13303"><span class="ln">13303 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I don’t want to go in,’ Sam says.</span>
<a name="l13304"><span class="ln">13304 </span></a><span class="s0">The sewing machine shuts off.</span>
<a name="l13305"><span class="ln">13305 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam takes a step towards the window.</span>
<a name="l13306"><span class="ln">13306 </span></a><span class="s0">He raises a trembling hand and taps the glass.</span>
<a name="l13307"><span class="ln">13307 </span></a><span class="s0">Moxie looks up.</span>
<a name="l13308"><span class="ln">13308 </span></a><span class="s0">Her hair is caught in a frizzy bun.</span>
<a name="l13309"><span class="ln">13309 </span></a><span class="s0">A scowl fits over her lips, all vinegar and suspicion.</span>
<a name="l13310"><span class="ln">13310 </span></a><span class="s0">When she sees him, the scowl falters.</span>
<a name="l13311"><span class="ln">13311 </span></a><span class="s0">Her lips part in surprise.</span>
<a name="l13312"><span class="ln">13312 </span></a><span class="s0">He pushes away from the window.</span>
<a name="l13313"><span class="ln">13313 </span></a><span class="s0">He deserves that.</span>
<a name="l13314"><span class="ln">13314 </span></a><span class="s0">All of it.</span>
<a name="l13315"><span class="ln">13315 </span></a><span class="s0">He should just walk away now.</span>
<a name="l13316"><span class="ln">13316 </span></a><span class="s0">Steal another house.</span>
<a name="l13317"><span class="ln">13317 </span></a><span class="s0">But he doesn’t doesn’t doesn’t want to.</span>
<a name="l13318"><span class="ln">13318 </span></a><span class="s0">Something like fear.</span>
<a name="l13319"><span class="ln">13319 </span></a><span class="s0">She doesn’t walk to him, she flies.</span>
<a name="l13320"><span class="ln">13320 </span></a><span class="s0">He expects a slap.</span>
<a name="l13321"><span class="ln">13321 </span></a><span class="s0">And she hugs him.</span>
<a name="l13322"><span class="ln">13322 </span></a><span class="s0">His arms slip around her back.</span>
<a name="l13323"><span class="ln">13323 </span></a><span class="s0">She is endlessly warm, like hugging waffles with honey.</span>
<a name="l13324"><span class="ln">13324 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m angry,’ she says fiercely.</span>
<a name="l13325"><span class="ln">13325 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m angry at you but I also care so much.</span>
<a name="l13326"><span class="ln">13326 </span></a><span class="s0">I told you that, didn’t I?</span>
<a name="l13327"><span class="ln">13327 </span></a><span class="s0">‘How dare you get stabbed?’ ‘I’m nothing,’ he says.</span>
<a name="l13328"><span class="ln">13328 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sorry.’ She glances down then and sees his shirt.</span>
<a name="l13329"><span class="ln">13329 </span></a><span class="s0">She gives a sharp intake of breath.</span>
<a name="l13330"><span class="ln">13330 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You stupid beautiful boy.</span>
<a name="l13331"><span class="ln">13331 </span></a><span class="s0">Go sit on the steps.</span>
<a name="l13332"><span class="ln">13332 </span></a><span class="s0">Right now.’ Then she spins and runs inside.</span>
<a name="l13333"><span class="ln">13333 </span></a><span class="s0">Sam does as he’s told.</span>
<a name="l13334"><span class="ln">13334 </span></a><span class="s0">Then she unbuttons Sam’s shirt.</span>
<a name="l13335"><span class="ln">13335 </span></a><span class="s0">Blood soaks her fingertips.</span>
<a name="l13336"><span class="ln">13336 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s so cold.</span>
<a name="l13337"><span class="ln">13337 </span></a><span class="s0">He gets stuck lifting his arms high enough.</span>
<a name="l13338"><span class="ln">13338 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s Jeremy’s shirt, a superhero emblazoned on the front.</span>
<a name="l13339"><span class="ln">13339 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sor—’ ‘No, don’t say sorry again.</span>

<a name="l13345"><span class="ln">13345 </span></a><span class="s0">I deserve jail.</span>
<a name="l13346"><span class="ln">13346 </span></a><span class="s0">She takes his hands and their fingers fit together.</span>

<a name="l13358"><span class="ln">13358 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I think he swam here.’ ‘I ran,’ Avery growls.</span>
<a name="l13359"><span class="ln">13359 </span></a><span class="s0">Avery seems to have regained his breath.</span>

<a name="l13389"><span class="ln">13389 </span></a><span class="s0">Then he sets a phone next to Sam.</span>
<a name="l13390"><span class="ln">13390 </span></a><span class="s0">The phone might as well be another knife.</span>
<a name="l13391"><span class="ln">13391 </span></a><span class="s0">Except maybe he won’t be alone for ever.</span>
<a name="l13392"><span class="ln">13392 </span></a><span class="s0">So Sammy Lou picks up the phone.</span>

<a name="l13399"><span class="ln">13399 </span></a><span class="s0">He’d be a scene out of a horror movie.</span>
<a name="l13400"><span class="ln">13400 </span></a><span class="s0">And he’d be free.</span>
<a name="l13401"><span class="ln">13401 </span></a><span class="s0">Because, without hands, he’s worthless to her.</span>
<a name="l13402"><span class="ln">13402 </span></a><span class="s0">To the Maestro.</span>
<a name="l13403"><span class="ln">13403 </span></a><span class="s0">He won’t even try something like that.</span>
<a name="l13404"><span class="ln">13404 </span></a><span class="s0">A taste of fudge and freedom isn’t worth it?</span>
<a name="l13405"><span class="ln">13405 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s just not made for rebellion or risks.</span>
<a name="l13406"><span class="ln">13406 </span></a><span class="s0">Fantasising is all he’s good for.</span>
<a name="l13407"><span class="ln">13407 </span></a><span class="s0">Sick dreams of mutilation, apparently.</span>
<a name="l13408"><span class="ln">13408 </span></a><span class="s0">Which hand would he even cut off?</span>
<a name="l13409"><span class="ln">13409 </span></a><span class="s0">It scares Beck Keverich – the way he thinks sometimes.</span>
<a name="l13410"><span class="ln">13410 </span></a><span class="s0">His digital clock reads 5:12.</span>
<a name="l13411"><span class="ln">13411 </span></a><span class="s0">And he should’ve been up twelve minutes ago.</span>
<a name="l13412"><span class="ln">13412 </span></a><span class="s0">Beck peels his head off the pillows.</span>
<a name="l13413"><span class="ln">13413 </span></a><span class="s0">He wishes he could dissolve into them.</span>
<a name="l13414"><span class="ln">13414 </span></a><span class="s0">Did he even sleep last night?</span>
<a name="l13415"><span class="ln">13415 </span></a><span class="s0">His wrists ache like he’s been juggling blocks of cement.</span>
<a name="l13416"><span class="ln">13416 </span></a><span class="s0">Did he quit at eleven?</span>
<a name="l13417"><span class="ln">13417 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers moan, it was midnight, you fool.</span>
<a name="l13418"><span class="ln">13418 </span></a><span class="s0">His fingers are cantankerous like that.</span>
<a name="l13419"><span class="ln">13419 </span></a><span class="s0">He slams the piano lid open.</span>
<a name="l13420"><span class="ln">13420 </span></a><span class="s0">The Steinway upright is the sole glory of his room.</span>
<a name="l13421"><span class="ln">13421 </span></a><span class="s0">Not that there’s much else in the room.</span>
<a name="l13422"><span class="ln">13422 </span></a><span class="s0">Although her curled lips and glares also speak volumes.</span>

<a name="l13440"><span class="ln">13440 </span></a><span class="s0">He can hear, he just can’t multitask and answer.</span>
<a name="l13441"><span class="ln">13441 </span></a><span class="s0">He hates these pieces the Maestro demands he learn.</span>
<a name="l13442"><span class="ln">13442 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s past eight.</span>
<a name="l13443"><span class="ln">13443 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s not even dressed or had breakfast.</span>
<a name="l13444"><span class="ln">13444 </span></a><span class="s0">Joey’s face puckers.</span>
<a name="l13445"><span class="ln">13445 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I made you lunch,’ Joey says, spider-climbing up his doorframe.</span>
<a name="l13446"><span class="ln">13446 </span></a><span class="s0">‘A surprise lunch.</span>
<a name="l13447"><span class="ln">13447 </span></a><span class="s0">She gives an indignant squeak and drops from the walls.</span>
<a name="l13448"><span class="ln">13448 </span></a><span class="s0">She’s giggling before he even starts to beg.</span>

<a name="l13463"><span class="ln">13463 </span></a><span class="s0">Beck wonders how often her students cry.</span>
<a name="l13464"><span class="ln">13464 </span></a><span class="s0">Beck slinks past, telling himself he did everything right.</span>
<a name="l13465"><span class="ln">13465 </span></a><span class="s0">She has nothing to erupt about.</span>

<a name="l13470"><span class="ln">13470 </span></a><span class="s0">Joey has a thing about making his lunch.</span>
<a name="l13471"><span class="ln">13471 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe he’d rather not know.</span>
<a name="l13472"><span class="ln">13472 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You’ll be late.’ The Maestro’s voice is deep and raspy.</span>
<a name="l13473"><span class="ln">13473 </span></a><span class="s0">Preschool is blissfully free of dress regulations.</span>
<a name="l13474"><span class="ln">13474 </span></a><span class="s0">They have to do this now?</span>
<a name="l13475"><span class="ln">13475 </span></a><span class="s0">Joey kicks the front door open with her glittered gumboots.</span>
<a name="l13476"><span class="ln">13476 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m gonna beat you there!’ she yells.</span>
<a name="l13477"><span class="ln">13477 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Ja, Mutter?’ He uses German as a tentative appeasement.</span>
<a name="l13478"><span class="ln">13478 </span></a><span class="s0">Painfully slow seconds tick by like swats against Beck’s face.</span>
<a name="l13479"><span class="ln">13479 </span></a><span class="s0">He has to get out.</span>
<a name="l13480"><span class="ln">13480 </span></a><span class="s0">Needs to leave.</span>
<a name="l13481"><span class="ln">13481 </span></a><span class="s0">‘You woke late,’ the Maestro says.</span>
<a name="l13482"><span class="ln">13482 </span></a><span class="s0">‘I’m sorry.’ Suck up.</span>
<a name="l13483"><span class="ln">13483 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s the only way to get out alive.</span>
<a name="l13484"><span class="ln">13484 </span></a><span class="s0">The Maestro snorts.</span>
<a name="l13485"><span class="ln">13485 </span></a><span class="s0">‘Why are you inept at dedication and commitment?</span>
<a name="l13486"><span class="ln">13486 </span></a><span class="s0">It trembles violently and coffee sloshes over the side.</span>
<a name="l13487"><span class="ln">13487 </span></a><span class="s0">Which is highly likely.</span>
<a name="l13488"><span class="ln">13488 </span></a><span class="s0">He doesn’t like her to cross the road alone.</span>

<a name="l13884"><span class="ln">13884 </span></a><span class="s0">Maybe he’s suicidal.</span>
<a name="l13885"><span class="ln">13885 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m going to reach out.</span>
<a name="l13886"><span class="ln">13886 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s nothing risky about hello.</span>
<a name="l13887"><span class="ln">13887 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:17 a.m.): sorry you’ll be lost, Rufus.</span>
<a name="l13888"><span class="ln">13888 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m not used to reaching out to strangers like this.</span>
<a name="l13889"><span class="ln">13889 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:19 a.m.): Hey, Mateo.</span>
<a name="l13890"><span class="ln">13890 </span></a><span class="s0">He’s already connecting to the person I want to become.</span>
<a name="l13891"><span class="ln">13891 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:19 a.m.): Thanks.</span>
<a name="l13892"><span class="ln">13892 </span></a><span class="s0">Think I’m going to leave the hat here at home.</span>
<a name="l13893"><span class="ln">13893 </span></a><span class="s0">I don’t want the attention.</span>
<a name="l13894"><span class="ln">13894 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:19 a.m.): Good call.</span>
<a name="l13895"><span class="ln">13895 </span></a><span class="s0">A Luigi hat isn’t exactly a baseball cap, right?</span>
<a name="l13896"><span class="ln">13896 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:19 a.m.): Exactly.</span>
<a name="l13897"><span class="ln">13897 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:20 a.m.): Wait.</span>
<a name="l13898"><span class="ln">13898 </span></a><span class="s0">You haven’t left your house yet?</span>
<a name="l13899"><span class="ln">13899 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:20 a.m.): Nope.</span>
<a name="l13900"><span class="ln">13900 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:20 a.m.): Death-Cast called me a little after midnight.</span>
<a name="l13901"><span class="ln">13901 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:20 a.m.): What have you been doing all night?</span>
<a name="l13902"><span class="ln">13902 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:20 a.m.): Cleaning and playing video games.</span>
<a name="l13903"><span class="ln">13903 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:20 a.m.): Which game?</span>
<a name="l13904"><span class="ln">13904 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:21 a.m.): N/m the game doesn’t matter.</span>
<a name="l13905"><span class="ln">13905 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t you have stuff you wanna do?</span>
<a name="l13906"><span class="ln">13906 </span></a><span class="s0">What are you waiting for?</span>
<a name="l13907"><span class="ln">13907 </span></a><span class="s0">not great, is the kindest way to put it.</span>
<a name="l13908"><span class="ln">13908 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:22 a.m.): I asked you first.</span>
<a name="l13909"><span class="ln">13909 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:22 a.m.): Fair.</span>
<a name="l13910"><span class="ln">13910 </span></a><span class="s0">(3:23 a.m.): I spoke to that dick too!</span>
<a name="l13911"><span class="ln">13911 </span></a><span class="s0">Not his dick, exactly.</span>
<a name="l13912"><span class="ln">13912 </span></a><span class="s0">But I reported and blocked him afterward.</span>
<a name="l13913"><span class="ln">13913 </span></a><span class="s0">I promise I’m better than that guy.</span>
<a name="l13914"><span class="ln">13914 </span></a><span class="s0">I guess that’s not saying much.</span>
<a name="l13915"><span class="ln">13915 </span></a><span class="s0">Do you wanna video-chat?</span>
<a name="l13916"><span class="ln">13916 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ll send you the invite.</span>
<a name="l13917"><span class="ln">13917 </span></a><span class="s0">An icon of a silhouette speaking into a phone flashes.</span>
<a name="l13918"><span class="ln">13918 </span></a><span class="s0">“You see me?” “Yeah, hey.</span>
<a name="l13919"><span class="ln">13919 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m Mateo.” “Hey, Mateo.</span>
<a name="l13920"><span class="ln">13920 </span></a><span class="s0">I wonder why he’s so sweaty.</span>
<a name="l13921"><span class="ln">13921 </span></a><span class="s0">“Unless that’s too personal.” “Nah, don’t worry about that.</span>
<a name="l13922"><span class="ln">13922 </span></a><span class="s0">I don’t think ‘too personal’ should exist between Last Friends.</span>
<a name="l13923"><span class="ln">13923 </span></a><span class="s0">But not doing anything is hardly comforting, either.</span>
<a name="l13924"><span class="ln">13924 </span></a><span class="s0">I can do it.” “Can you?</span>
<a name="l13925"><span class="ln">13925 </span></a><span class="s0">There’s the whole you-not-leaving-your-house problem.</span>
<a name="l13926"><span class="ln">13926 </span></a><span class="s0">“Believe me, I know it can get ugly out here.</span>
<a name="l13927"><span class="ln">13927 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m not leaving the safety of my apartment that easily.</span>
<a name="l13928"><span class="ln">13928 </span></a><span class="s0">“And I would’ve been game with game over.</span>
<a name="l13929"><span class="ln">13929 </span></a><span class="s0">You gotta go for it.” Go for it.</span>
<a name="l13930"><span class="ln">13930 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s what I said in my profile.</span>
<a name="l13931"><span class="ln">13931 </span></a><span class="s0">“Okay,” I say.</span>
<a name="l13932"><span class="ln">13932 </span></a><span class="s0">“How do we do this?</span>
<a name="l13933"><span class="ln">13933 </span></a><span class="s0">Where we should we meet?</span>
<a name="l13934"><span class="ln">13934 </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m gonna find a different Last Friend.” “It’s really not!</span>
<a name="l13935"><span class="ln">13935 </span></a><span class="s0">I swear.” I almost drop the phone.</span>
<a name="l13936"><span class="ln">13936 </span></a><span class="s0">I’ve screwed everything up.</span>
<a name="l13937"><span class="ln">13937 </span></a><span class="s0">“Seriously, I—” “I’m kidding, dude,” he says.</span>
<a name="l13938"><span class="ln">13938 </span></a><span class="s0">Except this time it’s okay to fully relax—I think.</span>
<a name="l13939"><span class="ln">13939 </span></a><span class="s0">“Will do,” I say.</span>
<a name="l13940"><span class="ln">13940 </span></a><span class="s0">“See you in a bit, Mateo.</span>
<a name="l13941"><span class="ln">13941 </span></a><span class="s0">“Be safe, Rufus.” Rufus nods and ends the video chat.</span>
<a name="l13942"><span class="ln">13942 </span></a><span class="s0">It doesn’t matter how many times we look both ways.</span>
<a name="l13943"><span class="ln">13943 </span></a><span class="s0">Shedd ANDREA DONAHUE 3:30 a.m.</span>
<a name="l13944"><span class="ln">13944 </span></a><span class="s0">Rule number one of one: Deckers are no longer people.</span>
<a name="l13945"><span class="ln">13945 </span></a><span class="s0">Andrea knows there’s nothing she can do for these Deckers.</span>
<a name="l13946"><span class="ln">13946 </span></a><span class="s0">She won’t waste her breath praying for them.</span>
<a name="l13947"><span class="ln">13947 </span></a><span class="s0">She simply tells them they’re dying and moves on.</span>
<a name="l13948"><span class="ln">13948 </span></a><span class="s0">She doesn’t just tell people they’re dying.</span>
<a name="l13949"><span class="ln">13949 </span></a><span class="s0">She gives them a chance to really live.</span>
<a name="l13950"><span class="ln">13950 </span></a><span class="s0">But she can’t live for them.</span>
<a name="l13951"><span class="ln">13951 </span></a><span class="s0">That’s on them.</span>
<a name="l13952"><span class="ln">13952 </span></a><span class="s0">She’s already done her part, and she does it well.</span>
<a name="l13953"><span class="ln">13953 </span></a><span class="s0">RUFUS 3:31 a.m.</span>
<a name="l13954"><span class="ln">13954 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m biking toward that Mateo kid’s house.</span>
<a name="l13955"><span class="ln">13955 </span></a><span class="s0">Nah, he’s chill.</span>
<a name="l13956"><span class="ln">13956 </span></a><span class="s0">If not, we can always part ways.</span>
<a name="l13957"><span class="ln">13957 </span></a><span class="s0">It makes me feel a little better, at least.</span>
<a name="l13958"><span class="ln">13958 </span></a><span class="s0">MALCOLM ANTHONY 3:34 a.m.</span>
<a name="l13959"><span class="ln">13959 </span></a><span class="s0">“They’re not gonna find Rufus.</span>
<a name="l13960"><span class="ln">13960 </span></a><span class="s0">This is assuming Rufus is still alive.</span>
<a name="l13961"><span class="ln">13961 </span></a><span class="s0">But they’ll have their lives.</span>
<a name="l13962"><span class="ln">13962 </span></a><span class="s0">MATEO 3:42 a.m.</span>
<a name="l13963"><span class="ln">13963 </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s Rufus,” he says from the other side.</span>
<a name="l13964"><span class="ln">13964 </span></a><span class="s0">He nods at me.</span>
<a name="l13965"><span class="ln">13965 </span></a><span class="s0">But the hallway is empty and now Rufus is smiling.</span>
<a name="l13966"><span class="ln">13966 </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m on your turf, dude,” Rufus says.</span>
<a name="l13967"><span class="ln">13967 </span></a><span class="s0">“If anyone should be suspicious, it’s me.</span>
<a name="l13968"><span class="ln">13968 </span></a><span class="s0">“I’m sorry, I’m just .</span>
<a name="l13969"><span class="ln">13969 </span></a><span class="s0">His palm is sweaty.</span>
<a name="l13970"><span class="ln">13970 </span></a><span class="s0">“You ready to bounce?</span>
<a name="l13971"><span class="ln">13971 </span></a><span class="s0">This is a trick question, obviously.” “I’m ready-ish,” I answer.</span>
<a name="l13972"><span class="ln">13972 </span></a><span class="s0">I lock up.</span>
<a name="l13973"><span class="ln">13973 </span></a><span class="s0">I don’t feel uneasy, but I am guarded.</span>
<a name="l13974"><span class="ln">13974 </span></a><span class="s0">And that he’s also dying today.</span>
<a name="l13975"><span class="ln">13975 </span></a><span class="s0">“Whoa, we’re not taking the elevator,” Rufus says.</span>
<a name="l13976"><span class="ln">13976 </span></a><span class="s0">The elevator is risky.</span>
<a name="l13977"><span class="ln">13977 </span></a><span class="s0">We get stuck.</span>
<a name="l13978"><span class="ln">13978 </span></a><span class="s0">We get downstairs safely.</span>
<a name="l13979"><span class="ln">13979 </span></a><span class="s0">My hand hovers over the lobby door.</span>
<a name="l13980"><span class="ln">13980 </span></a><span class="s0">I can’t do it.</span>
<a name="l13981"><span class="ln">13981 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s a nice second away from reality.</span>
<a name="l13982"><span class="ln">13982 </span></a><span class="s0">“Go ahead,” Rufus says.</span>
<a name="l13983"><span class="ln">13983 </span></a><span class="s0">I don’t want to disappoint either of us, especially myself.</span>
<a name="l13984"><span class="ln">13984 </span></a><span class="s0">But being out here now is different.</span>
<a name="l13985"><span class="ln">13985 </span></a><span class="s0">There are lights on in my neighbors’ apartments.</span>
<a name="l13986"><span class="ln">13986 </span></a><span class="s0">Rufus claps, snapping me out of my trance.</span>
<a name="l13987"><span class="ln">13987 </span></a><span class="s0">“Bucket lists are pointless.</span>
<a name="l13988"><span class="ln">13988 </span></a><span class="s0">You’re not gonna get everything done.</span>
<a name="l13989"><span class="ln">13989 </span></a><span class="s0">I know it before Rufus shakes his head.</span>
<a name="l13990"><span class="ln">13990 </span></a><span class="s0">“Yeah, well,” Rufus says.</span>
<a name="l13991"><span class="ln">13991 </span></a><span class="s0">I just .</span>
<a name="l13992"><span class="ln">13992 </span></a><span class="s0">“This isn’t going to work.</span>
<a name="l13993"><span class="ln">13993 </span></a><span class="s0">It’s going to backfire on us.</span>
<a name="l13994"><span class="ln">13994 </span></a><span class="s0">Like a Decker hot zone.</span>
<a name="l13995"><span class="ln">13995 </span></a><span class="s0">“No point fearing it.” “Not that easy.</span>
<a name="l13996"><span class="ln">13996 </span></a><span class="s0">We’re not dying from natural causes.</span>
<a name="l13997"><span class="ln">13997 </span></a><span class="s0">I’m driving him crazy.</span>
<a name="l13998"><span class="ln">13998 </span></a><span class="s0">Don’t do your last day wrong.” Rufus is right.</span>
<a name="l13999"><span class="ln">13999 </span></a><span class="s0">I know he’s right.</span>
<a name="l14000"><span class="ln">14000 </span></a><span class="s0">No more arguing.</span>
<a name="l14001"><span class="ln">14001 </span></a><span class="s0">“We can do that,” Rufus says.</span>
<a name="l14002"><span class="ln">14002 </span></a><span class="s0">“I have nothing I’m gunning to do.</span>
<a name="l14003"><span class="ln">14003 </span></a><span class="s0">“What happened?” I say.</span>
<a name="l14004"><span class="ln">14004 </span></a><span class="s0">“Nonsense.” Rufus doesn’t elaborate.</span>
<a name="l14005"><span class="ln">14005 </span></a><span class="s0">But maybe that warning wouldn’t have mattered.</span>
<a name="l14006"><span class="ln">14006 </span></a><span class="s0">Rufus sees the bird too.</span>
<a name="l14007"><span class="ln">14007 </span></a><span class="s0">“Say what?” “I don’t have this dead-is-dead-so-just-walk-away attitude,” I say.</span>
<a name="l14008"><span class="ln">14008 </span></a><span class="s0">I need to check myself.</span>
<a name="l14009"><span class="ln">14009 </span></a><span class="s0">Again.” I quit my hunt.</span>
<a name="l14010"><span class="ln">14010 </span></a><span class="s0">“Here’s the thing.</span>
<a name="l14011"><span class="ln">14011 </span></a><span class="s0">The way its eyes darted around for help.</span>
<a name="l14012"><span class="ln">14012 </span></a><span class="s0">The bird dared to leave home, at least.</span>
<a name="l14013"><span class="ln">14013 </span></a><span class="s0">“What happened then?” “I have no idea,” I admit.</span>
<a name="l14014"><span class="ln">14014 </span></a><span class="s0">“Let me find you something for the bird,” he says.</span>
<a name="l14015"><span class="ln">14015 </span></a><span class="s0">Rufus appears beside me on his bike, pedaling slowly.</span>
<a name="l14016"><span class="ln">14016 </span></a><span class="s0">“It’s a couple minutes after four,” Rufus informs me.</span>
<a name="l14017"><span class="ln">14017 </span></a><span class="s0">I know many people won’t agree or understand this sentiment.</span>
<a name="l14018"><span class="ln">14018 </span></a><span class="s0">But birds do all of this too.</span>
<a name="l14019"><span class="ln">14019 </span></a><span class="s0">Other birds are living until their time is up.</span>
<a name="l14020"><span class="ln">14020 </span></a><span class="s0">“Sorry,” Rufus says.</span>
<a name="l14021"><span class="ln">14021 </span></a><span class="s0">Yo, Mateo is too good.</span>
<a name="l14022"><span class="ln">14022 </span></a><span class="s0">But I’m mad shocked to meet someone so .</span></pre>
