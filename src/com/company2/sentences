So selfdevelopment is fundamental in our plan.
Many teachers have begun with the how.
But how shall he be able to criticise himself?
To plunge is the only way.
You must learn to speak by speaking.
The real plunge no one can take for you.
A doctor may prescribe, but you must take the medicine.
Beecher was always perturbed before talking in public.
Apply the blacksmith’s homely principle when you are speaking.
Concentration is a process of distraction from less important matters.
The youth subordinated himself to the message he bore.
So must you, by all the determination you can muster.
If you have it, others are seeing it in you.

Rid yourself of this I-am-a-poor-worm-in-the-dust idea.
You are a god, with infinite capabilities.

Reflect that your audience will not hurt you.
Griswold descended into the BART station.
Griswold turned and faced the men.
His smile faltered.
Nonexistent at the moment.
“I’m running late for an appointment, gentlemen.” Mr.
Griswold wiggled his salt-andpepper mustache—a nervous habit.
“We have a friend in common,” the tall man said.
“Yeah, a friend.” The short man laughed hoarsely.
“Ah, I see.” Mr.
“I’m in quite a rush,” Mr.
“We want the book,” he said.
But these men couldn’t be talking about that book.
“I run a publishing company, gentlemen.
We deal with hundreds of books.
He jerked his neck back to his partner.
“We said fake names, remember?” “Whatever,” the other responded.
“This guy’s old.
“Help!” His cry echoed in the cavernous station.
Griswold felt something like a punch to his back.
Had he been shot?
He struggled to breathe.
Barry cursed and rushed forward.
He stooped beside Mr.
“I can’t believe this!” Barry cried.
“You have a gun?
You shot him?
That wasn’t part of the plan.” Clyde shrugged.
Barry slid his arms underneath Mr.
Griswold’s and dragged him backward to an empty bench.
With a soft grunt, Mr.
Griswold collapsed against the slick granite wall behind him.
Clyde pulled the book from Mr.
“That has to be it.” Mr.
Griswold’s vision blurred the two men together and apart.
“That’s a brand-new book!” he shouted.
“It’s still a book,” Clyde said.
“He’s a publisher!
He’s going to have books on him.
We were told to look for an old book.
The hum of people leaving the cars carried upstairs.
“We gotta get out of here,” Barry said.
The two men raced to the exit.
A boisterous group wearing black-and-orange jerseys rode up the escalator.
One of them noticed Mr.
Griswold slumped on the bench and ran over.
A man dialed 9-1-1 on his cell phone.
A woman crouched next to him and repeated, “Hang on.
All that work, all his plans.
His nearly priceless treasure would never be discovered.
“You ready?” Emily glanced at the clock.
One minute to go until Mr.
“I’ll leave the radio on.
I know you don’t want to miss anything,” he said.
Her brother couldn’t care less that they were moving again.
He never cared.
Matthew attracted friends like a rainbow attracts leprechauns.
And it never bothered him to leave them behind, either.
“You there, caller?” the DJ asked.
But I don’t know.
I’m feeling worried myself.
Griswold hadn’t shown up.
It was part of the new game!
Her mom rapped on the passenger door.
Griswold’s disappearance could be launched into a game.
A third-floor window slid open with a squawk.
“You’re blocking the driveway,” the woman shouted.
Lee, isn’t it?
We’re the Cranes—your new tenants?
“Mental note: Do not mess with her driveway,” Matthew said.
Matthew sat cross-legged on the ground.
“Sitway might work.” Emily smiled.
He carefully wrote in a Puzzle Power magazine.
He looked at Emily.
“Moving in?” he asked.
Emily startled a little and blushed.
Had she been staring at him long?
She raised the plastic bin filled with clothes.
“I’m delivering a pizza.” The boy blinked at her twice.
He spread his arms wide and rotated in a circle.
“Dibs on this room,” Matthew called from down the hallway.
It was narrow, like their building.
She’d never had a triangular closet before.
Emily slid the window up and reached an arm out.
Her fingertips almost brushed the neighboring house.
The window directly above hers slid open.
Emily snapped back inside, fearing Ms.
Instead, she heard a repetitive squeaking.
Bewildered, Emily tilted the bucket to see what was inside.
Emily reread the message.
It made no sense.
The boy on the stairs must have sent this.
And what about this grid?
Her mom leaned in her doorway.
But what would she say?
Did you send this to me?
Who else would it be from?
What am I supposed to do with it?
“What are you doing?” Matthew said from behind her.
“Can you go any slower?” Matthew asked.
“This is heavy.” Emily grunted.
She peeked in Ms.
The boy now wore swim goggles along with his scarf.
The grid had to be the key.
Why include it?
When she tried reading it backward, it was gibberish.
The first letter of each word spelled out fifteen.
That couldn’t be a coincidence.
But fifteen what?
And that still didn’t explain the grid.
The clue was a partially finished magic square.
Then she ran downstairs and jumped on the landing.
Lee’s voice rang down the stairs.
“James!” she said.
“Check your bucket,” Emily called after him.
Mary’s Hospital after being mugged in a BART station.
Any plans for a new game were postponed indefinitely.
The words critical condition had worried Emily.
Griswold, Emily couldn’t help feeling disappointed about his game.
Griswold was doing.
By Jack Kerouac, of course.
“Please?” Emily pleaded again.
She was hoping to avoid that alternative.
Treasure hunts were beneath him.
Good-bye, best friend and partner in crime; hello, pain-in-the-butt brother.
She knocked again.
The song abruptly stopped and then restarted from the beginning.
“What?” he shouted over the music.
“Want to go to the Ferry Building?” Emily shouted back.
“What?” he said.
“You asked if I wanted to go and I don’t.
James says we can take cable cars to get there.
“Fine,” he said.
“What is that?” Emily asked.
“This is where we’ll board,” James said.
A cluster of tourists on motorized, standing scooters approached.
“They’re doing a tour of Lombard Street,” James explained.
Emily rolled her eyes.
“He means fan videos.
And then he shared it on his own blog.
“Oh yeah?” He smoothed his lopsided Mohawk with one hand.
Matthew studied the cowlick, then nodded.
“Steve’s got good taste,” he said.
There was no seat belt or anything.
Everything James pointed out had a story attached to it.
“How long have you lived here?” Emily asked James.
My family has lived in our building forever.
I think my grandfather bought it in the sixties.
My bedroom was my mom’s when she was a kid.
She couldn’t wrap her head around that.
“And I don’t even remember that.
“I was born in Arizona, Phlegmily was born in Washington.
So they thought, Why not live once in every state?
“A couple of times a month, maybe.
It was a simple but stately building.
“Matthew, come on,” Emily said.
This was her favorite part of book hunting.
“We look for the book.
It should be hidden somewhere around here.
“No!” She slapped the ground in frustration.
“What’s wrong?” James asked.
Emily pulled the calling card loose and stood up.
“Who’s Babbage?” “I don’t actually know him.
It’s a username for another Book Scavenger player.
He could be anyone.
This is my card.
My first username was something generic, like booknut123.
I never changed it back.” “Surly Wombat.
There was another one just ahead, and then another.
“What’s with the flowers?” Matthew asked.
“We drove by this yesterday.
IF IT WEREN’T for the pile of mementos honoring Mr.
A poster board leaned against the railing.
It read: GET WELL SOON, MR.
YOUR CITY NEEDS YOU!
“I feel like we should leave something,” Emily said.
He pulled out a bundle of leafy greens.
Emily held the card up to Matthew.
Get well soon, Mr.
You can’t write that.
Candyman, and wrote in Old Book Dude.
“So where did it happen, anyway?” Matthew asked.
“Do you think he was standing right here?” Emily shivered.
“Matthew, get back here!” Emily yelled after him.
“It’s not closed or anything,” Matthew shouted from below.
Griswold had been when he was mugged.
“Let’s get out of here,” Emily said.
“No way!” she said.
“A hidden book!” “Is that for Book Scavenger?” James asked.
“The Gold-Bug,” Emily read the title.
She flipped the cover open.
“There’s no tracking label on the inside.
But this must have been hidden, right?
Why would someone throw this away?
It looks brand new.” She considered the book again.
The gold beetle embossed on the front glittered at her.
What are you doing?
That’s rule number one.
VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED.
Matthew waved a hand dismissively.
“That’s like a ‘Beware of Dog’ sign for Chihuahua owners.
“Cut it out, seriously,” Emily said.
She stood and nodded toward the approaching men.
The men were uncomfortably focused on them.
Stop!” “Matthew, you idiot!” Emily said.
Run!” Matthew shouted.
James pushed past Matthew when they hit the sidewalk.
“Follow Steve!” James shouted.
His spiky tuft bobbed wildly as they ran.
James headed back in the direction of the Ferry Building.
“Excuse us!” James shouted as they dove through the line.
Emily looked over her shoulder.
“Keep running!” she shouted to James and Matthew.
James turned past a bakery and entered the mall.
“I think we lost them,” Matthew said between gasps.
“Quiet!” James held a finger to his lips.
A man swore, which echoed in the empty shopping center.
“My great-grandmother,” he explained to Emily.
First of all, what tournaments?
Like he saw them all the time?
He and her dad weren’t super close.
“You’re back!” she said.
“Did you guys eat?
“We’re good,” James said, looking to Emily for affirmation.
I haven’t even introduced myself.
I’m so sorry.
I’m James’s mom.
I’d shake a hand but…” She waved her flour-coated hands.
Something sputtered as it dropped in hot oil.
Stark and bland.
James’s apartment was layered with objects and smells and noises.
There were rugs and couches and decorative pillows.
Real plants that you had to take care of.
Filled to the brim.
Multiple bookshelves with not just books but collections.
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Emily said.
“Who would throw this away?” Emily asked.
Nobody would dump a book like this.
Emily flipped to the copyright page.
She clicked on the forum and posted a message.
Did anyone hide it and forget to register it?
“At the Ferry Building?
What did you call that guy?
A … poacher?
He didn’t even need those points.
Selfish poacher,” Emily muttered.
“Has Babbage declared any books?” James asked.
“Booker Middle School!” James read.
“He goes to our school?” “Or she,” Emily said.
She scanned Babbage’s book listings.
The computer dinged, and an instant-message box popped up.
RAVEN: Can I be of service?
“Who asks if they can be of service?” James said.
“Is Raven a butler or something?” Emily shrugged.
“Beats me.” SURLY WOMBAT: Service with what?
RAVEN: You inquired about THE GOLD-BUG.
“Oh!” Emily straightened.
“That was fast.
Raven knows about the book!
RAVEN: I cannot reveal the locations.
“The location’s been revealed, you weirdo,” Emily said.
I found THE GOLD-BUG in the BART station.
I’m trying to get credit for it.
“What’s with the history lesson?” James asked.
“I don’t think Raven actually hid this book.
“Let’s see if there’s anything new about Mr.
Griswold in the hospital,” Emily said.
What happens to Book Scavenger if Mr.
G doesn’t make it?
Emily breathed in sharply.
She had been worried about Mr.
She skimmed the posted reactions, finding an assortment of replies.
Most people were positive about the future of both Mr.
Griswold and Book Scavenger.
Hope I’m wrong.
A world without Book Scavenger?
Reading would be lonely without Book Scavenger.
Moving again would be unbearable without Book Scavenger.
“Well, it looks like nothing’s changed with Mr.
Griswold,” James said, breaking up her thoughts.
“We talked about making up a secret language.
“Right,” she finally said.
Emily dipped her nose in The Gold-Bug and breathed deeply.
It meant a bucket message was coming.
Emily crossed her room and slid open her window.
The bucket lowered beside Emily, and she removed James’s note.
It said, ZKTV TPU DXL QXBFC?
Gibberish to anyone else, but Emily knew what to do.
Emily wrote her reply: PUTQBFC CH.
IXLFQ 20 VDJXS.
Found 20 typos.
James’s reply came a few minutes later: KXNUZXPO.
ETF B SUU CH?
James knocked, and the bucket lowered back to her window.
DXL ZPBVU BF HXXOS?
WXXO ZKTV B IXLFQ—KTKT.
(You write in books?
She sent him a note back: DXL TFQ DXLP JLGGWUS.
☺ (You and your puzzles.
She groggily shifted under her covers.
Wait—did she just hear someone bowling?
Emily picked up the blueberry muffin from the floor.
“You’re such an idiot,” she snapped.
“Tough break for you, then,” Matthew said with a shrug.
“Same gene pool.” Emily shuffled to the kitchen.
She’d made her way through the whole story last night.
But that would be crazy.
Emily poured herself some juice.
“That would be quite a feat.
“I love that you’re so passionate about books and publishing.
No rest for the weary.
“Interesting theory,” he said and left the kitchen.
Emily unfolded the newspaper.
A photo of Garrison Griswold accompanied the article.
Emily hadn’t known that.
She bet the Lees had a specific location for scissors.
All normal kids who didn’t live like gypsies probably did.
“About my typo question—could someone do it intentionally?
Publishers pay me to keep typos out of books.
“No way,” Emily whispered.
This was Mr.
It had to be.
To start a game.
CHAPTER 10 EMILY HAD TO TALK to James.
“You’ll never believe this!
“I found another one last night.
He leaned over to study the torn news clipping.
Griswold?” “We found his next game!” Emily blurted out.
James looked back and forth between the two emblems.
“They’re almost identical.” “Exactly alike, except for the bird.
This book is Mr.
Emily nodded, her ponytail bobbing encouragingly.
“Do you think it’s a puzzle?” James asked.
“A word scramble, maybe?
James combed his fingers through Steve, deep in thought.
“I wonder why Poe?” James asked.
“What about that profile?
“We could look online.
“I thought Poe was … dead.
“Oh, it’s about a Rufus Griswold.
It began, Edgar Allan Poe is dead.
He died in Baltimore the day before yesterday.
“He must be related to Garrison Griswold, right?” James asked.
“I don’t understand what that means, though.
Griswold feels badly about it,” James suggested.
“Maybe the question to ask is, Why The Gold-Bug?
We read ‘The Tell-Tale Heart’ last year at Halloween.
I’ve never heard of The Gold-Bug before yesterday.
So why not use the more popular story?
Or any other story of his?
“This story is about a treasure hunt.
So … maybe Mr.
Griswold is planning something like that.” James’s eyes widened.
Griswold what game he had planned next.
He said he had something in the works, something major.
She couldn’t believe she’d found Mr.
Griswold’s next game.
As excited as she was that she’d found Mr.
But now she wondered what had been in that box.
“Finished!” Emily’s dad announced from the front room.
His footsteps echoed down the hallway.
He rapped loudly on Matthew’s door before entering the kitchen.
“I propose a treat!” he said.
“A treat?” Emily’s mom asked.
“Does it involve leaving the house?
“Let’s venture down to North Beach,” Emily’s dad said.
“I’ve been dying to see City Lights.” Emily perked up.
“The bookstore?” She remembered reading the name in Mr.
“The one and only,” her dad replied.
“Or I should say, the one and only City Lights.
I imagine there are many bookstores in San Francisco.
“Me too!” her mom said.
“Can we get lunch?” Matthew asked.
“Only in San Francisco!” he shouted.
He was so excited you’d think he was visiting Disneyland.
“Flush at the Fillmore, Dad.
That’s, like, my Jack Kerouac and my City Lights.
I have to go to that concert.
“Your dad didn’t say no.
We just need more information.
Her mom smiled at a book of poetry.
CHAPTER 11 THUD.
It was Monday morning, Emily’s third day in San Francisco.
Encrypted conversations only.
B OFXZ T CXXQ KBQBFC SJXV.
I know a good hiding spot.
Emily had lucked out moving into James’s building.
Emily stood still.
“It’s like out of a movie,” she said.
“The view.” Emily pointed.
“Yeah, I guess so.
“Like hiding a leaf in a tree,” he said.
“That was Hollister.
He owns the store,” James said.
James whistled long and low.
“How did he do this?” Emily asked.
“This must have taken him forever,” James said.
They pushed open the door.
“Hollister, your window looks amazing!” James said.
You finish the latest Puzzle Power?
“This is Emily.
“Small token of respect for a good man.
She looked to James questioningly.
“You’re friends with Mr.
Griswold?” “I said old friend.
A rarebook collector who manages his library.
But the way he acted, talking about Mr.
And if she was honest, part of her felt protective.
Sharing that might ruin the fun somehow.
She cleared her throat.
“Could we hide a book in your store?” Emily said.
“For Book Scavenger?
“It can’t be too difficult,” Emily said.
“Can I see your notebook and a pen?” he asked.
“Wrong side out under crafts.
She looked to the front where Hollister was.
“Most of my Poe is out here now.
He’s popular this time of year,” Hollister said.
Maybe that was all Mr.
They weren’t the same.
She exhaled a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding.
She opened Hollister’s and flipped through it.
“That one of your schoolbooks, Emily-Who-Just-Moved-Here?
Looks fancy.” Hollister’s voice made her jump.
She’d gotten lost in thought comparing the two books.
Griswold’s game, James wasn’t showing it.
“So old they’re written on stone tablets?
“I’m reading it for fun.
You say it’s just that one story?
Haven’t come across one like that before.
“You reading this?
“On the house.
Hollister pressed the book on top of The Gold-Bug.
She hadn’t stopped to consider why Mr.
“Raven?” James lowered his voice to Emily.
James raised his eyebrows.
She’s online,” Emily said.
SURLY WOMBAT: Can I ask you about THE GOLD-BUG?
Maybe then she won’t be so weird.” James shrugged.
RAVEN: I can’t help you with that.
SURLY WOMBAT: What do you mean?
RAVEN: I do not have the information you seek.
Emily slapped a hand on James’s desktop.
“I don’t understand this!
Emily groaned, but James straightened in his seat.
“She’s playing a game with us,” he said.
“No kidding.” “No, seriously.
There’s a pattern to how she replies.
SURLY WOMBAT: Do you like soda?
RAVEN: I do not have the information you seek.
SURLY WOMBAT: Plaid pants look nice on you.
RAVEN: I can’t help you with that.
SURLY WOMBAT: Who hid THE GOLD-BUG?
“You’re right!” James scrolled back through the conversation.
RAVEN: Your query is incomplete.
RAVEN: That is all the assistance I can offer today.
“That’s it?” James and Emily cried in unison.
“Well, she did tell us something at least.
“They’re not coming back,” Clyde said.
“This card is our lead,” Clyde said.
“Fat lot of good that card does us.
It’s got nothing on it—no address, no name, no number.
Just that picture of Earth and Too Slow!
This book has been found by: Surly Wombat.
After she took our book,” Clyde said.
“It’s not our book,” Barry muttered.
Didn’t talk about it, didn’t seem worried about it.
Almost like he didn’t even remember.
“I said: That’s.
That fugly fountain is cement tactics.
Bad cement tactics.
“What are you talking about?
You lost me with cement tactics,” Barry said.
“It’s our book, it’s their book.
It’s just words, you know?” “Oh,” Barry said.
“You mean semantics, numbnut.
Try reading more books instead of stealing them.” Clyde shrugged.
“I prefer cement tactics.
It’s poetic.” Barry sighed and held out his palm.
There’s nothing useful here.
You want to look up Surly Wombat?
“Maybe.” “Fine, better than the nothing we’ve been doing.
Barry flicked the logo.
“That must be for a business or something.
“These dotted lines outline letters!
It was like a hide-and-seek game with letters.
He was proud of himself for spotting them.
Clyde tapped the screen.
“Make that hidden book.” “We didn’t hide it.
She thought it was hidden there on purpose.
That’s why she left that card.
It was hard breaking into a new school.
“Hold on,” he said, and ran back upstairs.
“Take them,” he insisted.
How many first-day-ofseventh-grade pictures did a person need?
“Cheese!” he said.
“Or what do reindeer say?
Moo!” “What?” Emily laughed.
Students’ spiderweb art clung to a concrete brick wall.
Her attention bounced all over the place.
But it was easy to miss a detail that small.
So far that tactic hadn’t worked.
She thought it was more mean-spirited than competitive.
Fort, wild, rat, home.
The bell rang, and the two fell in step.
“Any breakthroughs yet?” James asked.
They had talked about Mr.
Emily shook her head in response to James’s question.
“Me neither,” he said.
“Can I see The Gold-Bug again?” James asked.
Fort, wild, rat, home.
I make a point of knowing everyone in our class.
Welcome to Booker Middle School.
Maybe she hadn’t been intensely focused on Emily after all.
Maybe that was just her normal expression.
The crowd parted as he boomed, “Let’s go, people.
We’ve got dead men to discuss.” Their teacher, Mr.
“New face,” he barked.
“Emily Crane?” “Yes,” she mumbled.
“Grab a textbook from the bookshelf.
“So, Emily Crane,” Mr.
She wasn’t from anywhere.
Quisling might interpret that as attitude.
“Um…” There were snickers behind her.
So much for thinking she’d imagined her negative attention earlier.
“I’m not grading you on your response, Ms.
Quisling clapped his hands twice to get everyone’s attention.
A-plus for that.
Just kidding, no grade.” Mr.
Quisling rubbed his hands together.
“Let’s get to work.
She copied the words Mr.
Making sure Mr.
She grabbed it and slid out the frog-shaped note.
Quisling spoke so he wouldn’t hear the rustling.
Quisling’s head snapped up.
Emily tucked the note inside The Gold-Bug.
“Is there a problem?” Mr.
Quisling said sharply.
“I’m sorry, Mr.
Quisling,” Maddie said.
Quisling walked down her aisle.
He picked up Maddie’s textbook and handed it back.
Instead of returning to the front of the room, Mr.
Quisling hovered over Emily’s desk.
“I don’t recognize this,” Mr.
She couldn’t bring herself to peek at James.
Quisling asked the class.
“Who knows what a cipher is?” Mr.
He turned to the whiteboard and wrote cipher.
Quisling’s board work.
Quisling blinked with lizard-like slowness.
Quisling began copying James’s note onto the whiteboard.
Quisling transcribe the note.
She couldn’t even bring herself to look at James.
“Julius Caesar developed one of the earliest substitution ciphers,” Mr.
“Today we call it the Caesar Shift.
She resumed cringing in horror once Mr.
Quisling finished copying James’s note: NTDHU VKU OUD BS IXPV.
B ETF VKBFO XI VKPUU.
Quisling tapped the whiteboard.
“What we have here is called a ciphertext.
Quisling wrote out the standard alphabet.
He’s enjoying this, Emily thought.
He is, he’s enjoying humiliating her!
Battles have been won and lost because of them.
“Are you sure we should be doing this?
Quisling waved to the board behind him.
“This is what you risk.” “If Ms.
Quisling stood back and rubbed his chin.
He circled the vk in vku.
Let’s go with that and see what happens.” Mr.
Students began calling out guesses for the words.
Before Emily knew it, Mr.
I CAN THINK OF THREE.
“Assassination diverted!” Mr.
At least James hadn’t mentioned Mr.
Griswold or his game in his note.
“I propose a challenge!” Mr.
“A cipher challenge, in the spirit of Edgar Allan Poe.
One cipher per student per week.
“Don’t lose your heads, people,” Mr.
Quisling bellowed over the din.
Quisling tapped papers into an even pile on his desk.
Do better tomorrow.” Emily nodded obediently, even though Mr.
Quisling wasn’t looking at her.
“Mad at you?” James said.
“You should be mad at me.
“How about a side bet?
“It’s always about winning with you, isn’t it?
“What’s in it for the winner?” Emily interjected.
Maddie’s calculating smile took on a slightly evil cast.
Maddie moved two fingers like alligator jaws across James’s hair.
She’d grown attached to the spiky guy.
But James didn’t look worried.
“And if you lose?” he asked.
“You can dye it,” Emily blurted out.
“Red, with white polka dots.
“Like I’m doing that,” Maddie said.
“Way better,” Emily added.
“You can wash the color out the same day.
“What’s Maddie’s problem, anyway?” Emily asked.
“She thinks she’s better than everybody.
Good old MopTop Maddie Fernandez.
Three adults waiting at a bus stop eyed them suspiciously.
“I can’t believe all the ciphers were broken.
This is going to be way harder than I thought.
I don’t want to shave off Steve.” “Don’t worry!
Her Royal Fungus is struggling with the challenge, too.
Emily bumped her backpack against his.
“You’re a puzzle master!
You’ve got this.
And I’ll help you.
“Visit Bayside Press,” James said.
“This is, like, sacred Book Scavenger territory,” Emily said.
The surrounding buildings were dull and serious in comparison.
“Hi,” Emily said when they approached the security guard.
“We’re here to see Joe?” James said hopefully.
The man looked over his glasses at them.
“Joe,” he said.
James nodded confidently.
“The last one?
Joe Young?” The man closed his binder.
“I made him up.
As I suspect you made up your Joe.
Sorry, kids, but this is a business.
Even if they didn’t find an answer to Mr.
“What if I told you we’ve found Mr.
Griswold’s next game?
The security guard barely looked at the book.
“I told them they need an appointment.
They say they’ve found Griswold’s next game, but you know.
We’ve heard that one before.” They’d heard that before?
“I’ve got this,” Jack said to the guard.
Griswold?” “And Book Scavenger,” Emily said.
“She’s really good at it,” James chimed in.
“Dedicated,” he said.
Emily looked down but smiled.
Still, the compliment and praise were flattering.
“Let me show you guys something.
Come on.” He led them to the elevator.
Griswold’s assistant.” “For real?
You actually work with Mr.
Griswold?” James asked.
“Like, every day?” Emily added.
“How’s he doing?” “Ah.” Jack looked down for a minute.
She hugged The Gold-Bug to her chest.
“Whoa,” Emily breathed out.
Griswold,” Jack said as they walked.
But no chocolate river or Oompa Loompas here.
“What’s all that?” Emily asked.
“I doubt it,” Jack said.
“I can’t say definitively, of course.
Griswold could and he’s—well, he can’t do that right now.
But I do know a couple of absolutes about Mr.
One: His games are rarely simple.
A logistical nightmare to pull off.
“And two: he is highly secretive about his games.
“‘The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett,’” he read aloud.
“Oh, my parents gave me that!” Emily said.
Jack took a moment before he replied.
“Books and games are how people feel close to Mr.
That’s what connects them to him.
They just thought we should know about it.
She really had found Mr.
She wasn’t just hoping it to be true.
It had to be solved.
You don’t think it’s part of the game?” Emily asked.
Jack smiled sadly.
But it doesn’t matter even if I did.
She was glad Jack didn’t believe her about The Gold-Bug.
“I’m glad I happened through the lobby when I did.
Griswold was most hopeful about reaching—young, enthusiastic, dedicated.
“I’ve got something else to show you.
She was proofreading a book.
Long, rectangular sheets made up the other stack.
Her dad called them proofs.
“You’re Jack Kerouac?
You’re my dad’s favorite author!
“Ah, well…” She needed to have Jack sign something.
“I’m not the Jack Kerouac,” Jack explained.
“Not the one who wrote On the Road.
He passed away decades ago.
Not that he knew I existed—my father, I mean.
“It’s served me well, though.
Griswold got a kick out of it.
Emily knew it at first glance.
Emily could envision Mr.
The man practically leaped forward and extended a hand.
So sorry if I startled you.
I work with Mr.
Griswold—at his home, not here at Bayside Press.
But I have his keys, you see?” Mr.
Remora held up a ring of keys and jangled them.
“I’m a rare-book collector.
I work for Mr.
Griswold—I said that already, didn’t I?
Griswold told me he’d left it in his office.
This book I’m looking for.
Remora the way you might an abstract painting.
I don’t recall doing that.
Absentminded and all that, you know?” Mr.
Remora tapped his skull with his index finger.
“We aren’t allowing anyone in here.” Mr.
Remora’s puppy-dog pleading eyes darkened.
“Aren’t children anyone?” he said.
“That’s enough, Mr.
Remora,” Jack clapped his hands.
“You’ve had your chance to look over these books.
“Sorry about that, guys.
“Is that Edgar Allan Poe?” she asked.
“Impressive!” Jack said.
“It is indeed.
Jack looked quizzically at James, but Emily spoke up.
“He’s a fan of his, then?” “Big-time,” Jack said.
Well, that solved one mystery, at least, Emily thought.
“Why is Poe wearing a necklace?” James asked.
“One of Mr.
Griswold’s most prized possessions,” Jack said.
“Of course you haven’t.
That was a silly question.
He pointed to the necklace.
“A hare, a rabbit.
This was in the seventies.
Griswold wasn’t the one to find it originally.
This had to be what Mr.
Griswold had planned.
But it spawned a whole genre called armchair treasure hunts.
Griswold loved this bit of publishing lore.
It thrilled her to know that.
James wanted to research ciphers for Mr.
“Now what?” Emily muttered, more to herself than anything else.
Emily started copying the letters onto her notebook.
Maybe the word isn’t fort but forth?
“You doubled an o,” Emily said.
It’s not to open; it’s topen.
James shook his head.
He gave a welcome speech at that book carnival.
He talks like a regular grown-up.
“That’s it!” Emily pointed to James.
“Me?” his voice squeaked.
“Help,” Emily said.
“Here.” She slid her notebook next to the keyboard.
RAVEN: I can’t help you with that.
“Nuts,” James muttered.
You have also located my game assistant, Raven.
Emily blinked at the screen.
She’d done it.
She’d found his next game.
She reread the message again.
RAVEN: One good story deserves another.
GUEST: I think you found my book.
Emily scrunched her nose.
SURLY WOMBAT: What book?
That’s my book.
I need it back.
Emily and James looked at each other.
The Poe book belonged to somebody?
That couldn’t be.
Raven had even confirmed it was part of the game.
Emily was a hundred percent sure the book was Mr.
Which meant that either this mysterious person was Mr.
SURLY WOMBAT: I find a lot of books.
Tell me about yours.
GUEST: It’s by Poe.
SURLY WOMBAT: Title?
GUEST: THE GOLD-BUG.
Emily’s stomach tightened.
James nudged her.
Maybe there’s another collection by that name.
Maybe this is a coincidence,” he said.
SURLY WOMBAT: How many stories?
The cursor blinked endlessly.
Emily held her breath.
SURLY WOMBAT: Sorry.
I don’t think I have your book.
“Sorry,” Barry muttered, and ducked his head.
“You shouldn’t have guessed three,” Clyde said.
“You told me three,” Barry said through gritted teeth.
Man, was he screwed.
This profile gave very little personal information and no photo.
“There we go.” He stabbed the words.
“You okay?” James asked.
Griswold’s had only one.
“That was just weird,” she said.
James nodded his agreement.
“‘One good story deserves another,’” she repeated.
“What could that mean?” The bell rang.
One good story—The Gold-Bug—deserves another … story?
Emily reopened the collection of stories and flipped through it.
“Ready?” James asked, hoisting his backpack onto his shoulders.
The first week of Mr.
Emily didn’t even submit one herself.
Griswold’s game, and her family’s adventures.
“As if I’ll lose!
Have some confidence.” Emily patted Steve on his pointy tips.
“My deepest apologies, Steve!
They approached Hollister’s bookstore.
“Hollister’s in there, talking to someone.
James stopped short, Emily right behind.
This was the same man who had been in Mr.
Griswold’s office last week.
“What is he doing here?” James whispered to Emily.
“No, no, now,” Hollister was saying.
“I said I’d found the Welty we discussed.
I wish you had called first, Leon.
“Ah, James and Emily-Who-Just-Moved-Here.
Just finishing up with my friend, Mr.
In fact, he’s the one I mentioned to you earlier.
The rare-book specialist who works with Mr.
Griswold.” To Mr.
It sounded funny to hear Mr.
Griswold referred to as a Gary.
Remora barely glanced in their direction.
If he recognized Emily and James, he didn’t show it.
And I tell you what, Leon.
Emily and James pushed around words while they waited.
It reminded Emily of first discovering Mr.
Griswold’s hidden words in The Gold-Bug.
Hollister pulled a pen from the mug by his register.
“So what brings you kids in today?
More book scavenging?” “Oh, um.” Emily glanced at Mr.
“Haven’t thought about that place in years.
That’s where I met Ferlinghetti.” “No,” James interjected.
“It’s not a place.
There was a place called the Black Cat?
Go to the Black Cat.
Remora slapped his hand on the counter three times.
We’re not done here.
“And what about that Carver you had last month?
Is that still here?” “I believe so.
“We can look it up online,” she said.
James called after Hollister’s retreating figure.
“Don’t worry, Hollister!
We’ll google it!”
Emily’s eyes adjusted to the dim interior.
“We’re not here to eat,” Emily said.
She sounded like a mouse compared with him.
“We left something,” James said.
“Last night,” Emily added.
“With our families,” James jumped in.
What if there hadn’t been any large groups last night?
“All right, I’ll bite.
What did you leave?” “A, um, book,” Emily said.
James poked her in the back.
But she didn’t know how Mr.
Or did they have to find it hidden somewhere?
“I’ve got a cell phone, sunglasses, and an umbrella.
No book.” “Could we look around for it?
We won’t take long,” James said.
“We won’t mess anything up,” Emily added.
“So what are we looking for exactly?” James whispered.
Emily lifted a tablecloth and peered under a table.
“I have no idea,” she said.
“I’m hoping we’ll know it when we see it.
Hollister wasn’t kidding.
They had looked over every inch with no luck.
“You find your book?” he asked without looking up.
“Um, no,” Emily said.
Emily hesitantly climbed onto the one next to him.
“Nope,” he said.
“Well, have you read it?” James asked.
“It’s actually an Edgar Allan Poe book we’re looking for.
“So what have you been doing?
You get into the liquor?
“What?” he said with a shake of his head.
“No, I don’t have a clue for you kids.
Go play your game somewhere else, okay?
James had his binder open again to Maddie’s cipher.
Gray buildings, liquor stores.
Its sign read PORTSMOUTH SQUARE.
Bright red pagoda-style awnings covered picnic tables.
“Hey, James.” Emily elbowed him.
“Isn’t that Hollister?” James looked up.
James absentmindedly plucked at Steve.
“Hey, Emily,” he said.
“What if Mr.
Griswold never finished his game?
It had to be.
“Well, maybe we should focus on Mr.
Quisling’s cipher challenge for a little bit instead.
James gave an apologetic wave.
“Sorry!” “Steve has nothing to worry about,” Emily reassured him.
CHAPTER 21 IN MR.
He was irritated because he hadn’t cracked Maddie’s code yet.
“It’s only Tuesday,” Emily reassured him.
James smacked Maddie’s finger away from his head.
“What, no plucky retort?” Maddie asked.
James yanked his backpack zipper closed with a ferocious tug.
“She didn’t make it up herself,” James said at lunch.
“It’s an alphabet from the Dark Ages called Ogham.
I found it when I was researching ciphers online.
“She copied it straight out.
If you know Ogham, you’d understand her message.
Quisling called over.
Emily’s lips felt dry all of a sudden.
She wasn’t behind on homework.
She hadn’t done anything to get on Mr.
At least she didn’t think she had.
James gave her a questioning look.
Kids filtered in for Mr.
Quisling’s seventh period as she approached his desk.
She didn’t know what to say.
She was surprised by all this—Mr.
“Do you remember the book I’m referring to?” Mr.
“Yes,” Emily said.
“I hid it again through Book Scavenger.” Mr.
Quisling raised his eyebrows.
Maybe he’s wrong.” He frowned.
He’s not another Book Scavenger player trying to trick you.
Remora was a book collector.
Griswold when they walked in on him at Bayside Press.
How many rarebook collectors could there be in San Francisco?
Remora knew about Mr.
Maybe he didn’t realize that Mr.
“Earth to Emily.” Mr.
Quisling snapped his fingers.
“You’re not in trouble here.
It’s a simple task.
You found a book that belongs to someone else.
Retrieve it and give it back.” Emily nodded.
But she’d already made so much progress with Mr.
It couldn’t hurt to finish it.
That way, Mr.
Everybody would win.
* * * “So what did Mr.
Quisling want?” James asked as they walked away from school.
“Do you remember Mr.
The book specialist who works for Mr.
Griswold?” “That guy we saw at Bayside Press and Hollister’s?
Of course.” “Well, apparently he’s looking for The Gold-Bug.
Our principal told the teachers, and because Mr.
And apparently the day that burned my Gold-Bug in Mr.
Quisling’s memory.” “Your Gold-Bug?” James smirked.
“I thought it was Mr.
Griswold’s.” “You know what I mean.” “So why does Mr.
Remora want The Gold-Bug?
“Of course not!” Emily said.
“How would we finish the game?” James stopped walking.
Even though Mr.
“Hollister?” James called.
They heard his whistle in return.
“Still there,” she said.
“One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest!
Nice used condition.
“Well, hey there, you two!
The Black Cat?” “You didn’t go there,” Hollister said.
The floorboards creaked underfoot.
“Um, actually we did,” James said.
“The Black Cat’s closed,” Hollister said.
“On Broadway,” James added.
“There’s your problem.
The one I’m talking about was on Montgomery, not Broadway.
“It closed?” Emily asked.
James paid for his books.
“We went to the wrong one!
“I concede defeat!
Gold letters spelled CANESSA PRINTING CO.
“A printing company?” James said.
“That makes sense, with Mr.
“Another restaurant?” he said, disappointed.
A brand-new-looking flyer with a photo of … a cat?
Emily went closer for a better look.
A photo of a black cat.
“Who is it?” she asked.
The recorded message repeated.
“It says we’ve typed too few digits.
Try again,” he said.
“It must be because of the zero.
“Maybe it’s not supposed to be a phone number.
Maybe it means something else.
A math equation?
“I have to go.
“Of course I remember,” she fibbed.
Griswold was attacked.
Griswold wasn’t doing well.
One user, CaptainOverpants, claimed to work in Mr.
Griswold’s hospital and said that Mr.
The whole exchange was exhausting to follow.
But that was easier said than done.
She couldn’t shake her worry that Mr.
Griswold, but Book Scavenger, too.
Griswold and his game.
She had once found a copy of Escape from Mr.
This looked like the perfect opportunity.
Now to decide which book to hide.
“We’re practically there.” “Only in San Francisco!” their dad replied.
This was one of the games they often played.
Imagining life, sometimes ridiculously, lived long-term in one place.
Emily watched gray buildings whiz by.
“Your turn, Emily,” their dad said.
“Ooh, yes,” her mom said.
“If only.” And Emily wondered, why if only?
“Anyone hungry?” Emily’s mom sat down the bag of sandwiches.
“I’m going to hide my book,” Emily said.
She could feel them get hot.
It was stupid of her to care.
She had known he wouldn’t want to join her.
“Matthew, go with your sister,” their mother said.
“I’m not going far, and I’ll be super quick.
With a sploosh, it went under.
She could see her family’s blanket from here.
She wished James could have come with her tonight.
He would have liked the whole hiding-a-book-underwater thing.
CHAPTER 24 MONDAY MARKED the third week of Mr.
Quisling’s cipher challenge.
“I found this section about the Baconian Cipher,” James said.
Emily leaned in to hear his whispered words.
“Bacon, like bacon and eggs?” “Exactly.
A cipher that tastes delicious on any sandwich.” James grinned.
“No, Bacon was the guy who came up with it.
He likes banana bread and drives a station wagon.
“This is a normal paragraph,” she said.
“Emily.” James tipped his head down.
Beware the ninja monkey.
Maddie glared at them from across the room.
“Sorry,” she whispered to James.
But it was shout-worthy.
“No sorry needed.
It will torture her to know she’s doomed.
So what about the black cat phone number?
Like: 97806797226 Forty-Ninth Street?
“I need to borrow this,” Maddie said.
“We’re supposed to share.
“That’s not a library book.
It’s mine,” James said.
Heads all around the room turned in their direction.
The school librarian popped out from behind a bookshelf.
She tapped the bar code on James’s book.
James flipped over his other book.
Its ISBN also began with 978 and had thirteen digits.
Emily’s collection of Poe works had another thirteen-digit ISBN number.
Every book had a similar but unique number.
Griswold had made it especially for his game.
Griswold’s clue leads to another book!” Emily said.
The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett.
“No way,” Emily said.
“That must be it!” James said.
“But why did the flyer say to call Samuel?
“He used ‘Samuel’ because of that.” She tapped the screen.
“Dashiell Hammett’s real first name was Samuel.
Now what were they supposed to do with this clue?
The satisfaction of accomplishing something could be very fleeting.
“I feel like this book is familiar for some reason.
“It’s set in San Francisco.
The bell rang, signaling the end of lunch.
“Doesn’t matter anyway.
She wrote Dashiell Hammett in her notebook and circled it.
Around the author’s name she wrote: Born here?
Wrote books here?
Quisling?” Next to Emily, James raised his hand.
“Class is almost over.
“So it is.
I assume you have one, Mr.
At the same moment, Maddie stood up.
“It was right here,” he muttered.
“Excellent, Maddie.” Mr.
Quisling held the page forward for the class to see.
Griswold’s next clue.
Quisling turned the cipher around to study it.
“Maddie’s name is typed on this,” he commented.
Quisling said as the bell rang.
“That’s James’s cipher.
You know how I feel about cheating.” Mr.
Quisling ripped the paper in two.
He didn’t talk as they left Room 40.
They walked silently past slamming lockers and laughing students.
“It was a short paragraph.
“Maddie doesn’t like to lose,” James said glumly.
“And she should be.
You could still use your bacon-and-eggs cipher.
“Maddie stole the cipher key, too.
“This is never going to work,” Barry said.
“We’ll find them,” Clyde said.
“You’re a high-strung kind of guy, aren’t you?” Clyde said.
Barry bit at a cuticle.
“Is this your idea of fun?
Barry followed the direction of his finger without much enthusiasm.
They’d seen purple backpacks before.
“What do you think?” Barry asked.
“Bingo,” he said.
“Bingo,” Barry agreed.
Griswold’s latest clue.
“So, you don’t know anything about Dashiell Hammett?” she asked.
Emily continued talking.
“That car,” James said.
The car rolled out of its spot.
They’re leaving,” James said.
Those men were turning around and headed in their direction.
“James,” Emily said.
“What are you doing?
I don’t think we should talk to them.
The men couldn’t even double-park their car without stopping traffic.
Emily and James quickened their pace.
“We’re not going to hurt you,” the man added.
“Oh, well, now I really trust them,” Emily muttered.
A dog in the doorway of a clothing boutique yipped.
“Are you sure about this?
I can’t run very fast uphill.” “Trust me.” James panted.
“We have enough of a head start.
The backs of her legs throbbed.
Her bangs were matted with sweat.
Her breath came out in gasps.
A few more steps and the ground was level again.
“C’mon.” James wheezed.
Their feet pounded the shadows of trees.
Leaves crunched underfoot.
“We’re almost there,” James shouted.
Ahead, a line of cars slowly inched forward—a traffic jam.
“Welcome to Lombard, crookedest street in America.” James panted.
And that was when Emily realized who the men were.
CHAPTER 27 EMILY CLUTCHED the railing.
James yelled, “Go, go, go!” but she was transfixed.
The men argued.
James pounded back up the stairs and shook her arm.
“What happened to you back there?
“Didn’t you recognize them?
Those men?” “You did?” “They’re from the BART station.
But Emily was sure those were the BART station men.
But how could they have found them?
She replayed that Saturday afternoon: She found Mr.
“What?” James eyed her warily.
“They found my Book Scavenger card.
With my username on it.
Griswold’s book?” James repeated.
“Don’t you get it?
James spoke to his backpack instead of her.
Not this again.
“It was completed, James.
The Black Cat clue led somewhere—don’t you see?
That we go to Booker.
“It’s not just those men, Emily.
Then we found out Mr.
Remora needs it.
Griswold’s scavenger hunt leads to must be valuable.
Remora?” James asked.
Griswold’s book, and Mr.
“Just admit you want to play his game.
She hadn’t helped him with the cipher challenge at all.
All that time wasted.
Griswold’s game again.
I wanted your help.
Those men were scary, but something valuable was at stake.
Something that mattered to Mr.
And that made her determined to get to it first.
“It’s important,” Emily said.
It’s not.” Each word pushed James’s volume up and up.
James was right—she hadn’t helped him with Mr.
But part of her was upset with him anyway.
For her, playing Mr.
Griswold’s photo across the room.
As she flipped through it, a memory nudged her.
Griswold’s next game.
The piece Emily was currently trying to figure out.
“Matthew,” Emily said.
Matthew turned, yanking out an earbud.
“What’s your problem?” “I need to use the computer.” “Sorry.
And it appeared to be taking him forever to finish.
Emily jumped back up.
“I just want to check on one thing,” she said.
“It will be quick.” “Why don’t you ask James?
“He doesn’t have a dozen computers,” Emily snapped.
“Anyway, this isn’t your computer.
“Why are you always so mean?” she exploded.
“You used to be fun.
“I can take a break.” Matthew saved his work.
“Whoa.” She straightened in her seat.
Fifty-two copies hidden in San Francisco alone.
But it was a big city.
There was definitely something going on with The Maltese Falcon.
And not just any Book Scavenger player: Raven.
SURLY WOMBAT: Who are you?
RAVEN: I do not have the information you seek.
“Yeah, yeah,” Emily said.
SURLY WOMBAT: Are you running Mr.
RAVEN: I do not have the information you seek.
Be coy,” Emily muttered.
She looked at the list of hidden Maltese Falcons.
She clicked on that.
She’d figured it out!
That was where she had to go.
Emily did a victory spin in the computer chair.
She had to tell James.
He’d probably even want to go with her.
One is at 1155 Leavenworth.
And then she waited.
There were no footsteps above, no sliding of James’s window.
Emily tried the knock again.
Maybe he wasn’t in his room.
Lee opened the door.
“Is your apartment on fire?” she asked.
For a moment, Emily couldn’t remember why she was there.
Is he here?” “One moment,” Ms.
Up the staircase she called, “James!
Or I could show him your research.” Ms.
Lee held out her spoon-free hand.
“That’s okay,” Emily said, backing away.
I mean Emily.” “What?” She didn’t bother turning around.
“I have some free time this week.
When she didn’t hear anything, she finally turned.
“Okay,” Emily said.
At Booker she’d started from day one as James’s friend.
She didn’t know what role to play anymore.
Emily continued outside.
Hello, loner girl with her nose in a book.
Haven’t seen you in a while, she thought.
“Did you?” Mr.
Emily looked hers over.
Matthew jumped up.
“All right, let’s go.
“You remembered,” Emily said.
“Of course, Phlegmily,” he said.
Why didn’t he do this with you?” Emily shrugged.
“You make a zillion friends every time we move.
It’s why you love moving so much.” Matthew snorted.
“I don’t love moving.
“This is how our life is.
Mom and Dad figured it out.” “Were they mad?” “No.
“You loved moving back then.
Metallic stars dotted the cities where they’d lived.
So I decided to just go with it.
Matthew was right—you missed out on stuff either way.
Or you gained stuff, depending on your perspective.
“Do we go in?” Matthew asked.
“I’m not sure,” Emily said.
Matthew tried the front door, but it was locked.
Emily studied a fire escape ladder.
“Should I climb it?” Matthew asked.
Something caught her eye perched high amid the leaves.
A large black bird peered down at them.
Do birds sleep with their eyes open?
Hey, Bird!” “Matthew!” Emily laughed, which only encouraged her brother.
“Yeah you, Bird!
I’m talking to you!” Still no reaction from the bird.
“That is really weird,” Emily said.
“What kind of bird are you anyway, Bird?” Matthew hollered.
“Are you a crow?
Or maybe a—” “Raven!” Emily realized.
“This is so cool!” Emily exclaimed.
“Now that’s a scavenger who went all out.
Must be Mr.
It looked like an average paperback.
Nothing written in it.
Nothing hidden in it.
Griswold’s edition of The Gold-Bug.
But now she saw it did not.
At one point she felt her brother studying her work.
She looked over and he pulled out an earbud.
“I don’t!” Matthew insisted.
It was fun when we used to go book scavenging.
Today was fun, too.
She’d said Mr.
Griswold’s game over the cipher challenge.
Or if she used T: ___ ___T___T___ Rotate?
Was that even a word?
Or A: ___ ___A___A___ Cravat?
Those were almost words, but they weren’t spelled right.
It was so … quiet and laughless working alone.
Interesting form of notetaking, Ms.
“Oh!” A bolt of inspiration struck.
That was the name.
Maybe she should even mention this new puzzle.
Fingers crossed Babbage would reply to her message.
“Tomorrow’s Halloween, Bob,” she said.
“Do the kids normally dress up here, Bob?” Bob nodded.
“I don’t know if you’re trustworthy, Bob.
Emily leaned over her shoulder.
“Can I check my messages real quick?” she asked.
“No, but you can check them quickly,” her mom replied.
Orange lights glowed in the trees.
“All yours,” she said.
Babbage had replied!
I have first period in Room 40.
We can talk there.
SURLY WOMBAT: Hi, Raven.
I found another clue.
RAVEN: I can’t help you with that.
RAVEN: Charlie, Sally, Lucy.
“What kind of hint is that?” Emily muttered.
Beggars can’t be choosers, though.
She’d have to think on this hint a bit more.
The hallways were nearly empty.
“Oh!” Emily stepped backward.
“I’m supposed to meet a student here.” Mr.
Quisling set down his pen.
He hadn’t dressed up for the holiday.
He cracked a smile.
“Boo to you, too,” he said.
Emily’s face warmed.
I like it.
“It’s not for school.
Before she laid a hand inside, Mr.
Quisling cleared his throat.
The Gold-Bug sat prominently on top of her notebook.
She’d completely forgotten she’d told Mr.
“I’ve already seen it.
There’s no use trying to hide it,” Mr.
“It will be much worse if you lie to me.
I am giving it back.
Quisling’s mouth formed a thin, tight line.
His next words came out very slowly.
She couldn’t meet Mr.
From the moment she’d met Mr.
Quisling, she’d been on his bad side.
“Let me get this straight.
Quisling said, Emily shrank an inch.
“I wasn’t going to keep—” Mr.
“Give me the book.” She had to make him understand.
Quisling, it’s not what you think.” Before Mr.
Quisling cut her off, she rushed on.
Griswold’s next game.
And I can prove it.” CHAPTER 32 MR.
Quisling’s expressions were like a closet of pressed gray suits.
All pulled together, all professional, all respectable.
“That was my first clue,” she said.
“And then I found a secret message in the story.
Griswold made this book with typos intentionally left inside.
Quisling held up a hand.
Which is why I don’t want to see it.” Mr.
“I’ve met him, you know.
Griswold.” He patted The Gold-Bug.
“Then you should understand better than anyone,” Emily pleaded.
She couldn’t say the words.
She had stopped checking for updates on how Mr.
“He would want his game to be played.
Quisling wouldn’t get it, just as James didn’t.
“You’re probably right, Emily,” Mr.
She almost felt tricked.
“But why?” she finally managed to say.
“I know who this book collector is— Mr.
I’ve met him.” Mr.
Now both of Mr.
Quisling’s eyebrows went up.
“We ended up getting to go in Mr.
Remora was in there when he wasn’t supposed to be.
Griswold had already hidden it for his game.
It wasn’t supposed to be in Mr.
Do you have confirmation of that?
Remora lie about Mr.
Griswold being his client?” Emily tugged on her backpack zipper.
I’m sorry, Emily.
I really am.
“We’re clear.” Mr.
Emily left his room fighting back tears.
Emily bumped against a skeleton’s backpack.
“Sorry,” she muttered.
Later that day, Emily averted her eyes from Mr.
Quisling when she walked into social studies.
“Good afternoon, Emily,” he said as she walked past.
Which, ironically, Emily realized was now true.
So what did it even matter anyway?
No sign of the old tan car.
A metallic pounding grew louder as Emily approached Hollister’s.
Hollister’s door was propped open.
“Emily-Who-Just-Moved-Here!” Hollister shouted over the drilling when she entered.
“Today’s been a game of Pick Your Poison,” Hollister said.
“Suffer through that racket or work in an oven.
So what’s new with you?
You still enjoying Poe?” Poe.
Quisling was probably talking to Mr.
“You mind?” he asked, nodding toward the twine.
He held the notepad out.
“Can’t read my own writing.” Emily leaned forward.
“It looks like 2634 Octopus to me,” she read.
“Is that for Mr.
“How do you know Mr.
Remora?” Emily reminded him of that day.
“You told us he’s a rare-book specialist and Mr.
Griswold is one of his clients.” “I remember now.
Indeed, I did.
“Do you need help delivering your books?
Hollister adjusted his wizard hat.
“Isn’t that kind of you.
Thank you, doll.
Too young to be my employee for one.
Hollister watched her push magnetic words.
“You know,” he said.
“I appreciate my customers.
And many of them are fine, fine people.
But not all book people are good people.
Both were book people.
Both seemed like good people.
Griswold in a time of need.
Have you talked to Mr.
“I don’t like thinking about that,” she said.
But then he said, “Gary was young.
This bookstore used to be Mr.
Griswold’s, too?” She envisioned Mr.
“This was before Bayside Press, of course.
We were young.
But—also like Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Peter Martin—our partnership eventually severed.
Ours less amicably, I’m afraid.” “Why?” “Similar interests, different priorities.
Money changes your circumstances, but it can’t change your core.
A spiteful person becomes a spiteful person with money.
“That’s bound to happen.
Emily took a deep breath.
There’s no ‘how’ about it.
That’s all a good friend is.
That’s what Gary did for me.
CHAPTER 33 EMILY LEFT Hollister’s.
“We want that book,” he leered.
“Clyde!” the tall man snapped.
The fake smile disappeared.
Emily clenched fists around her backpack straps.
Long flights of stairs led to front doors.
“We don’t want to hurt you,” the tall man said.
Don’t want to wasn’t as reassuring as aren’t going to.
“Just wait,” he said.
“What—” Her voice croaked when she tried to speak.
She started again.
“Let’s not play games anymore, okay?
“This is a waste of time!
Let’s just grab her bag and go!” “No!” Barry snapped.
“No,” he repeated, more calmly.
The problem was, she really didn’t have the book.
And what would they do if they didn’t believe her?
She couldn’t outrun them.
Her only choice was to outsmart them.
An idea came to her, but it was risky.
Griswold’s book as she hoped they did.
“Is it Poe?” she asked.
“You know it is,” the tall man said.
She took another step backward and uphill.
Any space she could create between them, the better.
She did her best to look indifferent and bored.
“You wrote in it!” Clyde shook the book.
“I … I did,” she said.
Two books lost in one day.
Not a good day for a book scavenger.
A best friend where she’d never had one before.
Easier than solving an Encyclopedia Brown–level clue in Book Scavenger.
She wanted to tell James about those two men.
And losing The GoldBug.
Griswold’s past as co-owner of Hollister’s bookstore.
And that she’d discovered Babbage’s secret identity.
She missed James.
But she couldn’t risk the possibility of Ms.
Lee opening the door again instead of James.
Of asking to see James and having him reject her.
After her meeting with Babbage/Mr.
Maybe she hadn’t lost out on everything, after all.
Griswold’s game, Gold-Bug or no Gold-Bug, James or no James.
She was disappointed when James kept walking.
He had been on his way to the bathroom.
“Pigpen,” she heard his voice say from behind her.
“What?” He’d been studying her paper over her shoulder.
You’ll see it.” And that was it.
He walked away.
Emily studied her work again.
She’d also written down Raven’s hint: Charlie, Sally, Lucy.
Not the same.
But Pigpen had to mean something.
Emily went to the computer bank.
Pigpen was the name of a cipher!
CHAPTER 34 SCARAB.
Scarab was the word Poe’s narrator used in The Gold-Bug.
Like the inky-black one on the inside page.
Griswold was directing her.
Back to The Gold-Bug.
Back to the book that had been taken away.
This was it.
She’d reached the end of the line for Mr.
And then vacuumed up the pieces for good measure.
To choose to stop now would have been one thing.
She raised her head and caught James studying her.
They both looked away as if their eye contact burned.
The bell rang and Emily started to pack up.
“Did you get it?
Pigpen?” “Oh.” Emily looked down for a second.
I was happy to help.
* * * That afternoon in social studies, Mr.
Quisling asked for any final attempts to break James’s cipher.
The room remained silent, and Mr.
Quisling said, “Mr.
Lee, your cipher has survived the week.
Quisling looked somewhat bemused.
“Your message still doesn’t make sense.
Quisling?” Before Mr.
Quisling could reply, Emily spoke up.
Right?” she asked James.
He nodded, smiling.
“This is the cipher key I used.
Emily joined in without even thinking about it.
It wasn’t too late.
A while later the ceiling creaked.
Whether or not he’d check it was another story.
And Babbage is Mr.
Quisling?” He shook his head, disbelieving.
You’re one up on Maddie now.
Griswold’s game going dormant.
She’d rather have played some of Mr.
Griswold’s game than none of it at all.
“Can I help you?” he asked.
“I…” she stammered.
“What are you working on?” she asked.
James didn’t look at her.
“James, come on.
Are you still mad?
“No thanks to you.
“I mean, binary code?
Doesn’t that seem kind of obvious?
“I practically dropped the papers at her feet,” James said.
And then the rest is up to Mr.
Quisling collected the cipher challenge submissions.
Quisling accepted it and looked it over.
“Is this a joke, Ms.
The cipher belonged to Babbage, copied word for word.
They figured either Mr.
Quisling’s stare shift momentarily to herself.
Quisling knew she knew his Book Scavenger identity as Babbage.
Emily studied the carved diamond on her desk.
Quisling addressed Maddie, not Emily.
“I know this cipher, Ms.
in their cipher language.
Having her disqualified was an added bonus.
“What?” Maddie cried.
“That’s not fair!” “Disqualified.
End of discussion,” Mr.
“That’s the sound of Steve celebrating my win.
Don’t worry—you’ll look great as a redhead.” Maddie blushed.
I didn’t lose.
Disqualification wasn’t mentioned,” James said.
It’s a stupid bet.
I wouldn’t have made you shave your head.” James snorted.
“You’ll start a toadstool trend!” James called after her.
“Embrace your fate!
“Not a chance,” he said.
“It’s okay, though.
Watching her squirm was better than the toadstool hair.
She probably would start a trend.
“Sorry about that,” Emily said.
“What’s going on?” Emily shouted.
“It’s a celebration!” her dad said.
“All we had was orange juice.
But I don’t care!
Freshly shaved swirls dotted his skull.
“Celebrating me going to the Flush concert?
“50 Homes in 50 States sold!
A feeling something like dread was overtaking her.
Why was she being such a Scrooge?
She knew she was ruining the moment for her parents.
What an idiot she’d been.
She sat on her bed, her backpack still on.
James pushed open her door.
“Are you okay?” he asked.
He leaned into the adventure and all that.
No Jack Kerouac quote could help her now.
She didn’t care what was waiting around the next bend.
James shifted from foot to foot.
“Now is the only time.
“Emily,” her mom said.
She slammed the front door behind them.
She pulled open the back door.
“Scoot over,” she said to Matthew.
“What are you doing?” Matthew said.
“You don’t have tickets!” “Just move,” Emily said.
“Where are we going?” James whispered.
I need to finish Mr.
“That’s where they’re going.” “But…” James plucked at Steve.
“I remember his address.” James raised his eyebrows.
“Well, I remember most of it.
It’s sevens and ones, like 1177 or 7171.” “Oh.
With every loop, Emily scanned street numbers.
She knew Mr.
That had to be it.
James was right beside her.
“Where are you guys going?” Matthew called.
Emily walked more quickly.
Matthew left his friends and caught up to them, panting.
“You came all this way for a book?
Can’t it wait?” Emily spun on her brother.
“No, it can’t, Matthew.
Would you be happy about it?
Would you just say, ‘That’s cool.
She assumed her brother would go back to his friends.
“Let’s move, people.
She’d expected something shabby and brown, like Mr.
“What do you want me to do?
Scale that tree?
“He’s a rare-book specialist.” She walked up the stairs.
“What are you doing?
What is she doing?” Matthew said to James.
Remora opened the door.
We’re not selling cookies.
My sister has something to ask you.” “Mr.
I know Mr.
“Don’t you remember us?” James piped up.
“We saw you in Mr.
Griswold is one of your clients.” “Well.
Good for you,” Mr.
“I still don’t know what you’re talking about.
Perhaps you should check again with your teacher.” “Didn’t Mr.
“Emily?” James asked.
“Are you okay?” A sickening feeling overtook her.
She’d told Mr.
Quisling about the game.
“I need to sit down,” she croaked.
Remora’s door with his free hand.
Remora pushed back.
“What are you doing?” Mr.
“Can we come in for a second?” Matthew asked.
Remora, and he and Emily tumbled inside the house.
“I’m fine,” Emily gasped, although her vision was spinning.
“Emily?” That was James crouching next to her.
Plenty for Mr.
“How could I have been so dumb?” she moaned.
Confiding in Mr.
Quisling, of all people.
Once a poacher, always a poacher.
Piles and stacks and towers of books were everywhere.
A dark hallway led to the back of the house.
“Can she have a glass of water?” James asked.
Remora had picked up his phone.
“Get over here,” he snapped into the receiver.
Remora threw his hands in the air.
Remora closed the front door and flipped the dead bolt.
“You do have it!” she cried.
The golden beetle greeted her, shining in the rose-hued light.
Quisling hadn’t tricked her.
But then … “Why did you lie?” She faced Mr.
James and Matthew flanked her on either side.
“It’s none of your business.
Why does it interest you anyway?
Remora twisted the dead bolt and tugged the door open.
“Took you long enough, Clyde,” he snapped.
Barry stepped forward.
Remora said impatiently.
“It seems they’ve come to help us.” Mr.
“Let’s drop the charade.
Not the specifics, per se.
“Why don’t you let these kids go?
We can just chalk this up to a mix-up.
So let’s work together.
I’ll even let you have The Gold-Bug as a keepsake.
You wouldn’t be interested in the prize anyway.
“Why else would I go to this trouble?
“I hate games.
What do you say?
The kitchen was in the farthest corner of the room.
“Well, you’re right.
We have practically solved it,” she said.
Her voice shook as she spoke.
“But we’re stuck on the last clue.
It’s a cipher.” James stared at her, mouth hanging open.
He knew she was lying.
They’d solved the last clue.
Emily tightened her grip on The Gold-Bug.
And he did.
Just as she hoped, Mr.
Remora walked into the kitchen.
Clyde chewed at a hangnail; Barry watched Mr.
She turned to James.
“You remember the last cipher, don’t you?
“Have you read all these books?” Emily asked Mr.
Part of her was stalling and part was genuinely curious.
“No chitchat.” Mr.
“Could I have that glass of water?” Mr.
She took a small sip and smiled.
Barry’s head dropped back on the sofa, eyes closed.
“I thought you had the clue memorized,” Mr.
Remora said, sounding more disappointed than suspicious.
“You forgot this,” James said.
Then in their cipher language James wrote Now!
Remora, getting the American Revolution books wet in the process.
“What the—” Barry sputtered, startled from his nap.
Remora spun this way and that, uncertain where to go.
Remora’s voice rang out.
Soon they reached the crowd lined up for the concert.
They charged through, dodging people.
“Where’s the fire, Crane?” one of Matthew’s friends shouted.
They passed the main doors of the Fillmore.
Angry voices flared behind them.
Emily dared a look back.
A cluster of people clogged the sidewalk.
She could hear Mr.
Remora’s nasally voice shouting, “Let me through!
A velvet curtain concealed the back of the bus.
You had one responsibility—keep groupies off the bus.
How hard is it?” “Sorry, Trevor,” Mikey sputtered.
“They flew around the corner.
This was Trevor, the drummer of Flush.
“Sorry we crashed your bus,” James said.
“At least I’m not.
I mean, no offense.
“Sorry,” he said.
Trevor chewed on his lip piercing while he studied them.
“Do these two talk?” he asked James.
Emily dropped her hands from her mouth.
“Sorry,” she said meekly.
“My brother is seriously your number one fan.
He’s not normally like this.” Matthew sputtered, “Five … FiveSpade.
I’m FiveSpade.” Trevor raised his eyebrows.
I thought you’d be older.
No offense, man, but that LEGO Domination video was sick.
“Man, this is a trip!” Trevor said.
He went to the curtain and called behind it.
“Zeke!” Matthew said.
“’Sup.” Trevor gripped his arm.
“Zeke—guess who this is.” Zeke looked Matthew up and down.
“Liam’s cousin?” he said.
Can you believe it?” “LEGO Domination?” Zeke nodded.
James stared out the window.
“See anything?” she asked.
He shook his head.
“They haven’t come down the street.
We lost them.” They’d gotten away.
Neil opened the mini fridge and tossed around sodas.
But don’t call it ’Frisco.
Gently, she ran her fingers over the top.
“What do you see?” James whispered.
Emily shook her head.
“Nothing.” She opened the cover and scrutinized the inside scarab.
Maybe she was wrong.
Emily sagged at the thought of this.
What would Mr.
Remora have done if they hadn’t escaped?
“Could I borrow that?” Liam looked scandalized.
“You can’t smoke!” Emily blushed.
“Like this?” he asked her.
“Too close!” Trevor yelled, noticing what Liam was doing.
Liam jerked his hand back in surprise.
The guys in the bus erupted in laughter.
“Sorry,” Liam said with a grin.
“It’s okay,” Emily said.
“I was right!” Emily waved Liam back to the book.
There must be invisible ink on this page.
We have to go there!” Emily said.
“Right now?” Matthew asked.
“I don’t know, Em,” James said.
It must be.
This is the treasure map that marks the spot.
We lost Mr.
If we do this tonight, we solve Mr.
Remora, too.” James tugged thoughtfully at Steve, considering all this.
“Don’t you want to see what Mr.
Griswold’s treasure will be?” Finally he nodded.
She stood up from the booth.
“We’re leaving now,” she said.
“Tonight?” Matthew asked.
“You don’t have to go,” Emily said.
Finally, he shook his head.
He turned to Emily.
“But I’m not letting you two go off by yourselves.
There’ll be more concerts.
“You’re a good bro, bro.
We’re heading backstage in a minute here.
A fog had descended on this part of the city.
“Do you know anything about this place?” Emily asked James.
“They call it the heart of Chinatown.
“So what are we looking for?” Matthew asked.
“Is that a pirate ship?” Emily asked.
Emily trailed her fingers over the engraving.
“Here.” Matthew whipped out his cell phone.
He cast the light of the screen over the words.
“Watch the poster!” Matthew said, shaking her off.
“The map said RLS—Robert Louis Stevenson!
He wrote Treasure Island.
This has to be it.
James inspected the nearby benches.
She ran her fingers through the grass.
Her fingertips brushed over something cold and smooth.
She thought it was a pebble, but it wouldn’t budge.
“It’s like the story,” Emily said.
Griswold wanted them to find.
James tried to lift the beetle but couldn’t.
It was attached to a stake in the ground.
The bottom of the stake widened into a mini shovel.
“Dig!” James said.
They pried the box from the ground.
Edgar Allan Poe.
Rufus Griswold was an accomplished editor, poet, and critic.
Sadly, you would be mistaken.
“There goes the battery,” he said.
“I have no idea,” Emily said quietly.
“I do,” a voice said behind them.
“Hand that over,” Mr.
Remora said, extending his hand.
Barry and Clyde stood behind him.
“You guys again?” Emily hugged the bagged manuscript.
“How did you find us?” James asked.
“You didn’t think you fooled me, did you?
Hiding on that tour bus?
“How did you know about it, anyway?” Emily asked.
She scanned the park for an escape route.
An iron fence enclosed the area.
Remora and his goons for the second time that night.
“I’ve worked for that man for a long time.
And he didn’t find the lost Poe manuscript.
Of course not.
We should have been partners.
A fifty-fifty split.
“Then Garrison planned this cockamamie game without consulting me.
Matthew shook his head and stepped back.
“He said, ‘Oh, but you will be a partner, Leon.
Griswold wouldn’t have been that mean.
That work deserves to be in a museum!
“And my hands are clean,” Emily added nervously.
“You’ll cut it up for paper dolls!” Mr.
“Hey now, Uncle Leon,” Barry said.
Remora whipped a finger toward him.
“You don’t get a say in this.
I trusted you with entirely too much.
This child has been more resourceful than you, Barry.
You lose money that’s not yours on horse races.
Emily’s eyes flicked from Mr.
Barry shifted from side to side, eyeing Mr.
“Garrison Griswold was a fraud!
Her sudden movement alarmed Mr.
“Dude,” Matthew said.
“I thought you threw that away!” Barry cried.
Griswold’s current uncertain state, followed by a tsunami of anger.
“You shot him over a book?
How could you do that?
He did nothing but positive things!
He might die now, and for what?
Griswold’s game was over.
He was still in critical condition.
Griswold might die, and Book Scavenger might die with him.
Nothing would change any of that.
Emily leveled her eyes at the three men.
“You are pathetic.” “He shot him, not me.” Mr.
Remora pointed to Clyde.
“But it had to be done.
As it stands now, nobody knows it exists.
It can be my discovery.
Remora rumpled his hair, looking suddenly uncomfortable.
Unfortunately, Barry did, too, and got to the gun first.
The dreadlocks would have been recognizable anywhere.
“Hollister?” Emily asked.
Barry swung the gun back and forth.
“Don’t stand there, idiot.
Do something,” Mr.
“What am I supposed to do?” Barry shouted.
Remora jabbed a finger in Emily’s direction, punctuating every word.
Manuscript.” Hollister remained crouched next to the unconscious Clyde.
“Leon, get a hold of yourself,” Hollister said.
“You stay out of this!” Mr.
Remora didn’t even look Hollister’s way.
“Hand me the gun, Barry.” “They’re just kids,” Barry said.
Barry swung the gun toward Matthew.
Emily pressed the manuscript even more tightly to her chest.
“He’s using you, man,” Matthew said.
“He doesn’t care about you.
Remora said in a calm, even voice.
“That’s not true.
You’re my flesh and blood.
“Five hundred dollars,” Barry muttered.
“That’s all?” Matthew said.
“You don’t care about me,” Barry said.
At the moment, Mr.
Griswold had no respect for literary treasures.
He was a savage!
He buried that manuscript in the ground!
“I’m so sorry I didn’t get to you kids before.
“Did you know about the game?
You knew it ended here?” “Yes and no,” Hollister said.
It became quite the phenomenon, and Gary was inspired.
Those were the pieces of his plans that I knew.
But it doesn’t surprise me.
I decided to keep an eye on the place.
“I have to apologize to you kids,” Hollister said.
“I thought this would be a harmless game.
I didn’t realize Mr.
Remora or anyone else was involved.
You get what he was all about.
She felt miserable for storming out the way she had.
Six months, nine months, a year.
“Remember this, Em?” her dad asked.
“So many good memories,” her mom said.
“Only in Colorado,” her dad said.
Emily knew where this was going.
Her dad cleared his throat.
Her mom flipped another page of the album.
That’s part of what appeals to us about it.
“We realize we’ve been a bit selfish,” her mom said.
“And you and Matthew are getting older.
“Your book is about us living in all fifty states.
We have a lot more to go before we’re done.
Griswold’s assistant, Jack, and discuss their prize for winning Mr.
Griswold’s scavenger hunt.
The elevator doors opened to the wine-and-silver-blue lobby.
Jack leaned against the receptionist’s desk, waiting for them.
“Follow me,” Jack said, ushering them down the hall.
“He’s eager to talk with you.” “He who?” Emily asked.
Jack stopped in front of a set of double doors.
It had only just registered that this was Mr.
Was she hallucinating?
“No way,” James said.
“Old book dude!” Matthew called out.
“You must be Emily, James, and Matthew.
A pleasure to meet you three!
“Largely because none of Mr.
Griswold’s personal belongings were stolen.” “Except one important one,” Mr.
Griswold added with a wink.
And, boy, has a lot transpired.” Mr.
Griswold and Jack had been talking.
Griswold was sitting right in front of her.
It all seemed a bit dreamlike.
“I hope you enjoyed my literary treasure hunt, despite Mr.
Remora’s antics,” he said.
“We did,” Emily said, her voice a near whisper.
She swallowed and repeated herself more loudly.
Griswold shook his head.
“I’m not sure anyone knows.
He and Poe had a contentious relationship, to be sure.
Griswold shook his head once again.
“What about … what about Mr.
Griswold sighed sadly.
I am so sorry about Leon.
“I was going to say hyperfocused.
Emily still wasn’t completely satisfied.
Remora said that he found the Poe manuscript.
I even had Mr.
“Not to mention, I compensated him for his work.
Compensated him very well, in fact.
The thrill and satisfaction of a treasure hunt?
“It’s about a community of book lovers, too.
Matthew elbowed her.
“And brothers.” “I think Mr.
Remora knew that with me involved,” Mr.
Griswold continued, “he’d only be a footnote in the story.
Remora’s claims about Mr.
Griswold, but it wasn’t until right now, hearing Mr.
“There’s something I still haven’t figured out,” James said.
Was it Jack?” Jack pointed to himself.
I’ve never even heard of Raven!” Mr.
“This is Raven.
My virtual assistant.
“I knew there was something weird about her.
Sounds silly, doesn’t it?” Mr.
Griswold adjusted his glasses.
Just my attempt to be a little tricky.” Mr.
Griswold cleared his throat.
Your prizes.” Mr.
She wasn’t sure how Mr.
Griswold said softly.
That’s what he told me, actually.” Mr.
“Did he now?
That’s sound advice.
Emily jumped up and grabbed it.
The Bayside Press logo was stamped on top.
“They’re here!” she squealed.
(Books are here!
“Finally!” Emily clapped her hands.
“I thought of a good bookstume,” he said.
“Yes, yes, yes.
But it wasn’t.
The introduction went on to tell the story of Mr.
“I can’t believe it.
We’re in a book!” Emily exclaimed.
“We’re famous book hunters!” James said.
“Page five,” she said.
“What’s the bread for?” he asked.
James slid Rhyme Schemer inside the bag.
“No, no, no.
Emily opened the sourdough bag to check for size.
“Squash it down more so it will fit,” she said.
“Now, that’s a bookstume,” Matthew said.
“You ready, Em?” “I’m ready.” And she was.
She was ready to lean into their next adventure.
Here is some background.

ANTONY’S ORATION OVER CÆSAR’S BODY Friends, Romans, countrymen!
The Noble Brutus Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious.
Was this ambition?
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
Has he, masters?
I fear there will a worse come in his place.
Mark’d ye his words?
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
We’ll hear the will: Read it, Mark Antony.
we will hear Cæsar’s will.
Read the will; we’ll hear it, Antony!
You shall read us the will!
Will you be patient?
Will you stay awhile?
I have o’ershot myself, to tell you of it.
They were traitors: Honorable men!
They were villains, murtherers!
Read the will!
You will compel me then to read the will?
Shall I descend?
And will you give me leave?
[He comes down from the Rostrum.
You shall have leave.
A ring; stand round.
Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
Room for Antony!—most noble Antony!
Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.
This was the most unkindest cut of all!
Oh what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Look you here!
Here is himself, mar’d, as you see, by traitors.
Oh, piteous spectacle!
Oh, noble Cæsar!
Oh, woful day!
Oh, traitors, villains!
Oh, most bloody sight!
We will be reveng’d !
Revenge; about—seek—burn—fire—kill—slay!—Let not a traitor live!
Hear the noble Antony.
We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him.
We’ll burn the house of Brutus.
Come, seek the conspirators.
Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
Hear Antony, most noble Antony.
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
Wherein hath Cæsar thus deserv’d your loves?
you know not!—I must tell you then.
You have forgot the will I told you of.
Most true;—the will!—let’s stay, and hear the will.
Here is the will, and under Cæsar’s seal.
Most noble Cæsar!—we’ll revenge his death.
O royal Cæsar!
Hear me with patience.
Here was a Cæsar!
When comes such another?
Never, never!—Come, away, away!
Take up the body.
Go, fetch fire.

WHAT IS IMAGINATION?
Therefore we must consider it primarily as 1.
Here association is potent to suggest similarities.
(e) The olfactory image is even more delicate.
Or were you ever “burned” by touching an ice-cold stove?
Recall it all—that far the image is reproductive.
But what followed?
Louis, the plaint of the peach pessimist from Pompton, N.
But these be mere externals.
The true harbinger is the heart.
Then (a) Re-image past emotion—of which more elsewhere.
(b) Reconstruct in image the scenes you are to describe.
Avoid general and prosaic terms.
The application is obvious.
All in all, master your images—let not them master you.
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 1.
Give original examples of each kind of reproductive imagination.
What is a “figure of speech”?
(a) What is an allegory?
(b) Name one example.

(See chapter on “Narration.”) 11.
It was a crisp and clear morning.
The light scent of wood smoke filled his nostrils.
Rekknodd sauntered into the group next.
Back then, nobody could avoid discomfort.
Compared to our ancestors, we have it easy .
They seek out and welcome challenges as opportunities to grow.
It’s central, in fact, to civilization.
In reality, nothing could be further from the truth.
I know, it’s shocking news, right?
This is the human condition.
Becoming a self-disciplined person is within everybody’s grasp.
Accept that and accept yourself, as well.
So, poverty imposes a mental tax.
Consequently, poor people find it harder to resist temptations.
Launching one of my businesses put me in debt.
It exerted immense daily stress on me.
Periodically try living without something that you consider a necessity.
You’ll benefit in several ways .
For this reason, consider occasionally meditating on your future self.
Building self-discipline is similar to writing a novel.
They’re talented, end of story.
I used to be a shy and fearful person.
Imagine a straight line.
Analyze your goals and how you approach them.
For example, regular exercise poses no challenge for my self-discipline.
Maybe you’ll skip a workout out of laziness.
Never excuse yourself.
Never pity yourself.
I sometimes get flak for my goals.
“You’re already slim.
According to my standards, the growth should never end.
If you have a headache, practise not cursing.
Don’t curse every time you have an earache.
—Gary Keller 20 Habits are like magical powers.
The challenging part is forming a new habit.
Once the proper habits kick in, things will get easier.
Better envy them instead.
Take it from there, step by step.
Tomorrow, do one more repetition.
Otherwise this technique won’t work.
However, it’s not about eating this specific cookie.
Consequently, you don’t have to live in defense.
Failure, rejection, and humiliation are anything but pleasant.
—Carl Jung 30 There’s nothing “normal” in building self-discipline.
Most people avoid all kinds of discomfort and effort.
Think of self-discipline in the same way.
—Fred Brooks 32 Patience and self-discipline are close cousins.
Without patience, you’ll get nowhere.
After enlightenment, chopping wood and carrying water.
The actions don’t change.
What changes is the person performing them .
Of course not.
Resist the temptation to set your aims low.
So I ran to the end of the road.
And that’s what I did.
I ran clear across Alabama.
For no particular reason I just kept on going.
I ran clear to the ocean.
What are the two?
Today we’ll approach the topic from a different perspective.
“Let’s call it a day.
I’ve already worked five minutes more than yesterday.
Moderation is key.” “I’ve already gone down two sizes.
It’s impossible to always follow the middle path.
Sometimes you’ll zig and sometimes you’ll zag.
Day 40: On Talking vs.
Humility plays an important role in helping you maintain self-control.
40 Assume that your self-discipline is like prosperity.
Consequently, you’ll work harder to keep it in your life.
But that’s just me talking.
Go and actually take an ice-cold shower.
There is no failure except in no longer trying.
—Elbert Hubbard 42 I’m an avid rock climber.
It’s the same with many other areas of life.
Chances are, success is right around the corner.
Express gratitude for what you already have.
Reframe negative events into opportunities and lessons.
Surround yourself with positive input.
Irresponsible spenders will realize they’re on the brink of bankruptcy.
Potato chip addicts will be diagnosed with diabetes.
The inactive TV fans will start taking hypertension medication .
$100 for another pair of jeans is a screaming deal.
—Diogenes Laertius 48 A forbidden fruit is the sweetest.
Just figure out what’s next.
I try not to associate with people who don’t think.
My relationship with food is often criticized by other people.
Trust your own judgment and think for yourself.
It was their dream, and by extension, my dream.
Don’t let yourself be lulled into inaction.
When you gain momentum, you’ll get exponential results.
My first book wasn’t actually my first book.
I’d been writing — articles, blog posts, books, etc.
Whenever setting a new goal, take the long-term approach.
In a sense, trials and tribulations are like training.
It’s all in the state of mind.
Rock climbing has made it particularly clear to me.
First, an unhealthy body leads to an unhealthy mind.
I can attest to these benefits.
Were there some benefits in spreading my attention so thin?
Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.
Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts.
Persistence and determination are omnipotent.
—Calvin Coolidge When in doubt, press on.
Their secret lies in persistence.
In the short term, my actions were extreme.
How about losing 50 pounds (or 20 kilos) this year?
But the will must be stronger than the skill.
For example, I struggled with extreme shyness as a teenager.
However, my will was strong.
Successful people don’t have fewer problems.
Problem-solving skills are exactly that — skills.
Most people would consider it an impermeable barrier.
Game over, say goodbye to your dreams.
What do you think?
Would you still go into debt to finance your toys?
Whenever you’re setting new goals, go beyond mere external rewards.
There’s nothing to lose, and potentially a lot to gain.
The focus is on the success, not the struggle.
I failed numerous times in business.
The same applies to virtually any other endeavor.
Reflect on what really matters to you.
I acted a lot, but thought too little.
Periodically pause and reflect on your own choices.
Are you pursuing goals that matter to you?
Day 75: On Hater s Luke!
Don’t give in to hate.
That leads to the Dark Side.
In the beginning, it bothered me a lot.
What do you do, sir?
“I was so self-disciplined and yet I failed!
In addition to client work, I built my own sites.
My income fell by over 50% overnight.
A similar phenomenon happens with other goals, too.
Here they are: 1.
A Guide to the Good Life by William B.
It is the best antidote for anxiety and depression.
It is a business asset.
It attracts and keeps friends.
It lightens human burdens.
It is the direct route to serenity and contentment.
I’m not going to sugarcoat it.
How will you maintain good spirits despite the negative circumstances?
If you are in pain, you will find fortitude.
If you hear unpleasant language, you will find patience.
Day 82: On Extreme Focus Take up one idea.
This is the way to success.
Why would I define myself as a non-drug user?
That’s behind you.
I’m a person who eats a plant-based diet.
Your decision to be self-disciplined has to be equally firm.
This phenomenon is most visible in entrepreneurship.
Some of them don’t even have an actual business.
You can apply the same mentality to every other goal.
Strive to increase order and discipline in your life.
—Dave Kekich 83 I used to be terrified of heights.
This way, I quit strategically instead of impulsively .
Let’s say you want to start a new diet.
In reality, things aren’t that simple.
As Epictetus says, there’s pleasure to be found in abstaining.
When in doubt, remind yourself that change takes time.
Take notice of whenever you overidentify with your emotions.
If possible, try to include exercise in your morning routine.
Most of us rarely, if ever, experience true silence.
As a second strategy, embrace silence in a conversation.
Another exercise is to practice self-control by using fewer words.
For one day, focus on listening to the other person.
Consider your actions and ask yourself what they express.
This way, we don’t actually have to change.
How many have you applied so far?
I’ll give you some examples from my own reading list.
I’ll share with you a personal example of mine.
This cynical rule isn’t always right.
If it were, nobody would ever be able to change.
It’s really quite simple.
If not, why listen to him or her?
Fortunately it strikes at nine every morning.
My preferred time to write is early morning.
How do you do it?
Let’s go with another example.
Think of it as learning how to play basketball.
Mindset changes are the same.
One successful shot doesn’t make you a great basketball player.
This delicious cake?
And what do you exchange for this indulgence today?
Is it really worth it?
After all, the end justifies the means, right?
Because humans are intrinsically afraid of loss.
The real allure of “FREE!” is tied to this fear.
And what are you losing?
Are the free snacks worth it?
If not, what’s so special about this deal?
Either write or nothing… I find it works.
Two very simple rules, a: you don’t have to write.
b: you can’t do anything else.
The rest comes of itself.
—David DeSteno 119 Research suggests that daily gratitude boosts self-control.
Each morning or evening express gratitude for five small things.
Such simple things are what makes life great.
Self-denial is ultimately a self-sabotaging strategy.
You’re missing out on the opportunity to overcome them.
As soon as you get up.
Jump in the shower.
Close your eyes and turn the temperature to cold.
Not just cold.
Not ice cold.
Do this for thirty days in a row.
I never give up on anything that’s important to me.
Time is my most important asset.
I always focus on achieving more in less time.
Growth happens outside one’s comfort zone.
Security leads to mediocrity.
A stranger bumped into you and didn’t apologize?
Consider it an exercise in manifesting mental toughness.
To do everything, simply because you can, lowers effectiveness.
Concentrate on the really important things that get amazing results.
Do only the few things with greatest benefit.
They embraced being bad so that they could get good.
Overcome the temptation to lower your bar.
Day 133: On Self-Carin g Self-discipline is self-caring.
Not just falling in love — staying in love.
I’ve devoted my life to it.
That might bother some people but it doesn’t bother me.
I enjoy the cottage cheese.
(…) Life isn’t very heavy for me.
I’ve made up my mind what I want to do.
More often than not, you’ll continue.
Exercise is a keystone habit that triggers widespread change.
— But this is more pleasant.
Is sleeping in more pleasant than doing work?
Obviously it is; otherwise nobody would ever do it.
The same situation applies to the investment world.
This provides a legitimate excuse not to start.
In reality, most things are simpler than you think.
They still managed to build successful businesses without Internet gurus.
Educate yourself about the basics and draw your own conclusions.
Choosing one thing means not choosing another.
However, not choosing either of them means losing both.
After all, it isn’t a big deal, so why bother?
WEEK 22 Day 148: On Fear Action cures fear.
As a rock climber, fear is my regular companion.
Then fear can actually save your life.
However, in most everyday applications, fear is unfounded.
What are your own weak points?
What are the interest rates your indulgences charge you?
Today, I often crave vegetables.
I no longer need to force myself to eat them.
—Darren Hardy 147 Money has present and future value.
At the very moment, 50 bucks is 50 bucks.
Alternatively, think of any purchase as hours of your work.
How about two or three hours of your life?
Is it still worth it?
So he stopped to fix it.
He is utterly, gloriously spontaneous, but he is hardly free.
He is, if anything, a prisoner to his unbridled spontaneity.
Going on an unplanned road trip.
Dancing in the rain.
Saying yes to random invitations.
For example, imagine you’re on a diet.
You can still be spontaneous without ruining your goals.
—Ernest Thompson Seton 149 In today’s world, nobody is self-sufficient.
Have a backyard?
Hire a gardener to tend to it.
Don’t want to clean?
Hire a maid.
Call a handyman.
Smells are more intense and flavors more explosive.
It doesn’t apply just to food.
In many aspects, your life is already incredible.
You are already naked.
There is no reason not to follow your heart.

Day 159: On Having Option s Always have options.
Options are a primary source of power.
It’s either A or B.
You either do it or you don’t.
Rarely, if ever, are there only two options.
What about continuing your career while building a side business?
Black-or-white thinking is mental laziness.
Go with the latter.
Do what expert putters do.
Living with such a mindset not only makes you happier.
Don’t allow his anger to become your anger.
Before you know it, you’re engaged in a verbal fight.
Each week, perform a quick review.
Don’t focus on mistakes alone, though.
If you don’t evaluate your behavior, you’ll make everything harder.
Why is that so?
Once established, they will be some of your biggest allies.
For example, Pablo Picasso worked between 3 p.m.
When you wake up and when you go to bed.
When you work.
This advice can be helpful for non-writers, too.
When you’re under stress, your ability to withstand pressure diminishes.
How many roles do you have?
How many of them affect your self-image?
The same happens with animals.
However, what is a healthy approach to self-discipline?
For example, I’m now on an overseas trip.
Lastly, don’t treat it as a permission to cheat.
What does it have to do with self-control?
However, in the end, our memories are fickle.
Who cares about dieting, exercise, money, etc.
Make sure you have a comfortable mattress.
Make sure you sleep in silence.
Any noise will dramatically reduce the sleep quality.
Use earplugs if there’s no way to soundproof your bedroom.
Make sure you sleep in the right temperature.
Make sure your racing mind is asleep.
It’s often effort that ultimately creates long-term satisfaction.
But the sooner you handle it, the easier it is.
Whenever I can I choose to pay in advance.
I’ve become fanatically intolerant of permanent irritants.
If you have trouble saying no, start small at first.
If you can’t find it, keep looking until you do.
Support other creators instead of criticizing them.
Resist the temptation to consume without ever contributing much yourself.
Obviously, this doesn’t apply to life-or-death situations.
In today’s world, we have too many choices to make.
Which brand of bread to eat?
Which fitness regimen to follow?
Where to go for a vacation?
Which book to read?
What are your rules?
The only crime is pride.
—Sophocles 186 Pride has a positive connotation.
Another aspect of pride is stubbornly following the wrong path.
The moment you realize you’re following the wrong path, stop.
Adventures spice up life.
Embark on new adventures as often as you can.
Learning new interesting skills can be an adventure in itself.
Plan your next adventure now!
This strategy works the other way, too.
Day 194: On Pain and Quittin g Pain is temporary.
Quitting lasts forever.
Ponder the common statement that life is hard.
Your maxims expose your character.
You hurt your children.
You hurt me.
You hurt the planet.
Strive to produce value for everyone, including yourself.
What’s the point?
You become what you teach.
You teach what you are.
Guess why I write books about self-discipline!
Psychologically, I think it means a release of energy.
And if it doesn’t, being prepared won’t hurt you.
You need to train patience like a muscle.
How do you become more polite?
It showed the power of mind over body.
—Arnold Schwarzenegger 202 Our limits come primarily from our surroundings.
Proving to yourself that you’re still in charge.
Day 207: On Enthusiasm and Endurance Enthusiasm is common.
Endurance is rare.
Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), life isn’t so simple.
In a sense, enthusiasm is a fair-weather friend.
Nobody forced me to stay there.
In the end, I saw it through to the end.
Any fool can do that.
The really important thing is to profit from your losses.
And how do you do that?
As an author, I track my books’ sales performance.
Don’t discount the value of a failure.
There’s a hidden treasure underneath each setback and struggle.
I dictate the reply to my secretary at once.
Better to batch them and take care of them later.
However, ultimately this strategy can generate more work.
However, this statement is only valid to a certain point.
Positivity breeds more positivity, while negativity spawns more negativity.
Does that sound like a behavior of a successful person?
This trick doesn’t just apply to dieting.
You can also use it successfully for other goals.
At first, you deny it.
Denial, hate, regret, or frustration ultimately only work against you.
Self-discipline is similar to self-defense in this regard.
What about dieting?
It isn’t that hard, either.
Only a healthy person can control their life.
A sickness can quickly remind you who’s the boss.
Accomplish something that endures?
With a monthly plan, you can make adjustments.
Things went bad from the start.
This in itself delayed my entire launch schedule.
I won’t lie: I was frustrated.
Protein is a miraculous macronutrient.
However, be careful to not increase your overall calorie intake.
I’m not going to lie.
At first, I added it to my todo list.
Treat the undesirable “future you” as your antimodel.
Instead of taking sides, I suggest being neutral about it.
This will help you introduce new routines with less resistance.
you spend fifteen minutes stretching).
The balls are called work, family, health, friends, and integrity.
And you’re keeping all of them in the air.
If you drop it, it will bounce back.
The other four balls… are made of glass.
“That’s simple,” says the old man.
“They are the prisoners of their personal history.
Are you studying because you want to study?
Are you a lawyer because it was your own choice?
Don’t forget your dreams.
No one can and no one may.
We ourselves must walk the path.
You won’t start exercising unless you find the right coach.
Don’t wait to be saved.
You yourself must walk your own path.
Adopt the same attitude when dealing with problems and setbacks.
The chaos that has ensued in your diet offers opportunities.
What makes you eat it?
What’s the underlying motive?
In what domains or situations are you lacking self-discipline?
How does it manifest?
For example, I sometimes climb with a blindfold on.
Then there is no choice but to move forward.
You will either succeed or lose in a big way.
The brick walls are not there to keep us out.
They’re there to stop the other people.
How valuable would that success be?
Then gradually, I write one page and then another.
If you’re facing a big project, embrace the same attitude.
Scott Peck 236 I have a friend who’s often late.
What do you think?
Ten minutes, once gone, are gone for good.
We think of it as broken into many pain-in-the-ass steps.
If we love something, it seems easy.
We imagine it as one fun step.
I’m running hard.
But I am separate from this pain.
You probably desire to have more money in the future.
Now let’s focus on the present.
Are they enabling the future you desire or disabling it?
Day 242: On Selectivity Few people take objectives really seriously.
Nobody in the world is good at everything.
Prioritize your objectives accordingly.
I will always let my reach exceed my grasp.
However, at the same time, you limit your accomplishments.
At the opposite end of the spectrum is golfing.
Write a full-length novel in two weeks.
Learn a foreign language in three months.
Make $5000 on the side in six weeks.
To have such clarity you must lead a disciplined life.
I warn you.
Look at every path closely and deliberately.
Try it as many times as you think necessary.
Ask yourself if your strategy is still delivering results.
Does it still feel right to you?
Paths, like any other tool, sometimes need to be changed.
The big ideas can often be applied to general life.
This big idea can be applied to personal growth, too.
First-order consequences of exercise are the pain and time spent.
Secondorder consequences are better health and more attractive appearance.
Take into account both the first-order and second-order consequences.
Day 248: On Reducing Your Targets Never reduce a target.
Instead, increase actions.
Or better yet, make it 250, just in case.
I don’t entirely agree with Grant Cardone.
Begin at the finish.
If you’re writing a movie, solve the climax first.
Imagine yourself as a person who has achieved your goal.
What have you avoided doing?
What are your beliefs?
How do you feel?
What would this person certainly not do?
Would he or she eat fast food daily?
Capacity, interest, and mental endurance all wax and wane.
Sometimes you’ll feel more determined, and sometimes less.
Plan according to your fluctuating levels of personal resources.
This doesn’t apply to fitness alone.
Don’t stick to a calorie deficit if you’re sick.
We hunch up our shoulders.
What is the answer to this nervous fatigue?
Learn to relax while you are doing your work!
Consequently, their bodies reflect their attitude.
In reality, tensing is counter-productive.
The same goes with work.
Whenever you catch yourself too tense at work, relax.
Make a conscious effort to work with poise.
I was Big Martin.
I sure as heck wasn’t Overweight Martin.
What’s wrong about being big?
What makes you think that you’re different?
Unfortunately, this is taking the path of most resistance.
For example, I’m a natural introvert.
Whenever you’re setting new goals, start with your self-image.
If there’s no action, you haven’t truly decided.
Speak with integrity.
Say only what you mean.
Obviously, some situations require scratching each other’s back.
Isn’t that prospect scarier than looking for a new job?
Unfortunately, it rarely, if ever happens.
It all starts with one decision.
I follow the same approach in my business.
How often do you monitor yourself?
Is it a part of your daily or weekly schedule?
If not, it’s time to make that happen.
You can use this phenomenon to improve your self-discipline.
Stretching can increase your strength by 10%.
It is a lot.
They spend more time reading than actually implementing advice.
Day 271: On How to Use Books Books...
Soon I found them all similar to each other.
Each new title added little to my knowledge.
Think of different categories of books as your development stages.
Perhaps you feel happier when you go fast.
I don’t know.
But what’s the alternative?
To do otherwise is to settle.
I used to be terrified of heights and taking falls.
They will still make you uncomfortable and scared.
It’s the price you have to pay for excellence.
Personal growth in general has its price, too.
People being confused about your actions.
Outgrowing certain people in your life.
An incessant desire to improve everything.
Self-guilt that you have it better than other people.
Don’t feel guilty because you made better choices.
Other people could have done the same.
A difficulty to enjoy what you have.
The same applies to other goals.
Spouses stopped putting in the effort.
Businessmen let their competition crush them.
Dieters reverted to their old habits and regained weight.
Day 279: On Learning With Ag e It’s very simple.
As you grow, you learn more.
Aging is not just decay, you know.
Now decay commences, and things can only get worse.
Think of it as driving a car in foggy weather.
Day 283: On Being Hungr y Stay hungry.
Don’t rest on your laurels.
Is waking up early generally a positive habit?
Is eating healthy a positive habit?
Of course it is.
—Kelly McGonigal 284 Don’t discount the power of small efforts.
They count, too.
It’s the same with self-control.
It’s the same with your goals.
The answer is: partly yes, and partly no.
You often can’t choose when you’re the most effective.
For me, it’s mornings, between 5 and 9 a.m.
Obviously, this affects my life.
I rarely hang out with my friends in the evening.
Don’t try to please everybody, because it simply can’t happen.
Stress and problems are tariffs that come attached to success.
Upon discovering this fact and realizing.
Thank you for downloading my book.

made the difference.
Yes, this is scary.
"Oh my God," she said.
We are constantly arguing.
Neither of us will budge from our positions.
No wonder we haven't been getting along!
I wanted to avoid easy solutions.
Above all, it truly had to improve communication between people.
I began to explore this approach, called Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP).
The results were remarkable.
It is both rigorous and flexible.
It can be woven naturally into casual conversation.
I have included the research abstracts in the appendices.
Since then much more has been written and researched.
Let's start with Programming.
Hence, this field is called Neuro-linguistic Programming.
He created the LAB Profile® in the early 1980s.
In Noam Chomsky's 1957 Ph.D.
It created a great deal of confusion.
Distortion The second process is called distortion.
We distort things.
Well, you were hallucinating.
Your furniture was not actually in the room, was it?
So, you were distorting Reality.
Two examples of distortion are hallucination and creativity.
That is what the process of distortion is all about.
Generalization Chomsky's third mental filtering process is called generalization.
This is how learning occurs.
The child develops a Generalization about how to open doors.
They develop the rule: Never trust a man.
Leslie Cameron-Bandler (now Leslie Lebeau) took Chomsky's work even further.
And all this shows up in how a person talks.
You can choose exactly those words that change minds.
This is where the notion of Context comes in.
and a verb.
This is used to create multifaceted communication strategies.
This is a favorite amongst business leaders and consultants.
Each category is dealt with in a separate chapter.
There are no good or bad ones to have.
For each category, the distribution of the Patterns is shown.
At the end of the book are complete profiling worksheets.
Level: Do it Now, or Have a Think About it?
What is your LEVEL of activity?
They do not wait for others to initiate.
They may consider and analyze without acting.
They believe in chance and luck.
They will spend a lot of time waiting.
They will wait for others to initiate and then respond.
They make good analysts.
Representatives on customer service desks tend to be more Reactive.
You can motivate Reactive people by matching their Pattern.
Guess what Pattern she has!
Wanna go?" He usually refused and became annoyed.
She enthusiastically agreed and wanted to do it right then.
This is the quintessential Proactive/Reactive conflict.
Do it now vs.
think about how to do it.
This is where I also have disagreements with my hubby.
Summary Level Question: There is no question for this category.
Proactive: Acts with little or no consideration.
Motivated by doing.
Reactive: Motivated to wait, analyze, consider and react.
But what does this mean?
Simone has given me her Criteria for work.
We each have our own definition for each Criterion.
(a job, a home, a spouse, etc.)?
What's important to you?
What has to be there?
What would you like to have, be or do?
You can do this for yourself or with other people.
I'll demonstrate with Simone.
This technique is called making a Hierarchy of Criteria.
Let's list them.
Which one attracts you?
Simone: A challenge.
In my left is one that has good remuneration.
If you had to choose, which one would you want?
SRC: So, challenge is the most important so far.
Which one would you prefer?
Which one would you like to take?
Simone: Good remuneration.
Simone: Good remuneration.
Simone: Working with people.
A challenge 2.
Good remuneration 3.
Working with people 4.
It can also be used when coaching employees or clients.
Can't Make Up Your Mind?
I have identified five situations where this occurs: 1.
One Criterion is a component of the other one.
The person has a conflict between two values or Criteria.
Many cultures, however, do not maintain this belief.
Life is about doing what you are supposed to do.
The weight of outside considerations is greater than their desires.
Then they can consider and negotiate with their external commitments.
In other words, one Criterion is contained within another Criterion.
on the other hand .
?" Difficult to Satisfy?
This person may be difficult to satisfy.
What is a decision?
Remember that, when you change Context, your Criteria may change.
Do they have the values you are looking for?
What do you want in a company?
What do you want in a team?
What's more important to you?
This (holding out one hand) or this?
Confronting a person is probably counter-productive.
Christine Blasey Ford, I received many comments on my approach[6].
How are you doing?
They might actually hit something.
Many people underestimate the power of matching someone's Criteria.
That's because I'm good at reading.
Question: What do you want in a ...?
What is important to you?.
Chapter 5 Direction: The Carrot or the Stick?
What will trigger a person into action?
In what direction do they move?
They can become energized by threats.
Identification Question: WHY IS HAVING THAT (THEIR CRITERIA) IMPORTANT?
SRC: All right, Adam, why is having that important?
Adam: To help people.
SRC: To help people.
And why is that important?
Adam: Because I get satisfaction from helping people.
SRC: So why is that important?
Adam: Well, that's what I want from a job.
SRC: Why is that important?
Joanne: It gives me a sense of calm.
SRC: And why is that important?
SRC: And why is that important?
Joanne: It keeps me from hitting my kids.
What's important about X?
What's in that for you?
Because you couldn't stand it anymore?
Or because there was something better on the burner?
Why did you leave your last spouse?
Why did you take your last vacation?
Can your Direction change over time?
Yes, it can.
Then he has a heart attack and what happens?
Some addiction treatment programs work on that basis.
Not motivated yet to change something?
It was Away From.
Why do I personally set goals in my business?
Because if I didn't, I would be totally disorganized.
What else do I need to predict?
What haven't I thought of yet that may go wrong?
Is It Fear of Success or Motivation Direction?
The Away From Pattern can impact goal achievement.
My life is really going down the tubes.
So, what's the problem?" Let's think about it.
So, let's look at what happened.
He was motivated to move away from poverty.
Let's put this on a graph to understand his pattern.
As he earns money, what happens?
His interest level declines as his revenue increases.
What are the negative consequences if you don't finish?
This is how deadlines can help.
That deadline kept us on track.
Positive or Negative Thinking?
Many journalists also have this Trigger.
They were 'moving away from' what they did not want.
Goals, business plans, objectives, and so on, are Toward activities.
Frequently, management and labor do not speak the same language.
Innovation and Funding Start-Ups: Who Gets the Cash?
What to do?
Political Divisions - a Matter of Toward and Away From?
They move away from sickness and dying.
They will consider such talk as offtopic.
Impending disaster will energize them.
They are not likely to pick out the errors.
Lastly, I did the fun part.
Then fix it.
I worked with them on their member challenges.
Insurance is another Away From product.
Investments, on the other hand, are inherently Toward.
Often marketing campaigns reflect the culture of the company.
Summary Direction Question: Why is that (Criteria) important?
[Ask 3 times] Toward: Motivated to achieve or attain goals.
Away From: Motivated to solve or avoid problems.
Away From: avoid; prevent; eliminate; solve; get rid of, etc.
Where does a person find motivation?
In external sources, or in internal standards and beliefs?
These Patterns affect how you make judgments and decisions.
They decide about the quality of their work.
They have difficulty accepting other people's opinions and outside direction.
"My boss wants this out by Tuesday?
They take information as orders.
"He said the green paper matches the decor.
They prefer when someone else decides.
He asked me how I wanted the training room setup.
Then I asked how he would like it.
External people do not hold standards within themselves.
My boss is happy.
Suzanne: Feedback from other people plus knowing myself.
How would you react?
something would be missing.
I'd have to go check what they didn't like.
Louise: I feel good about it.
Louise: They probably didn't see what I saw in it.
SRC: What happens when there is no external feedback?
Robert: I would feel, like, what's the point?
Where Do You Know That?
State what problem it avoids or solves (Away From) 3.
State the benefit (Toward) 4.
It's not perfect.
You may have already done this!
Hey, I'm going to try this out with my hubby!
I have called this kind of behavior The Macho Pattern.
Do you know people who: 1.
already know everything?
have no problems, everything is perfect?
if there are problems, they are of someone else's making?
And it's not only men!
Anyone can become Macho.
Just listen to radio interviews.
Once I sold a training program with optional follow-up coaching.
Now the coaching is just part of the training program.
There is something they don't already know, 2.
I am telling them what to do, 3.
They have a problem and I have the solution, 4.
They are not perfect in some way, and/or 5.
I am better than they are in some way.
You may wish to rephrase as follows: 1.
Use the language of suggestion: You may wish to consider...
How have you solved this problem?
(implies they have already solved all the problems) 4.
With your experience and knowledge in this area....
Your role is....
My role is...
I went out to supper with a friend.
The husbands need to determine that for themselves.
What Self-Esteem Is Not Someone asked me about these Patterns.
I would this call it a selfhandicapping strategy.
Do not, however, confuse an External Pattern with low self-esteem.
It is not the same thing.
Managers make decisions and set standards.
Customers have become much more Internal than they once were.
They would need to be certain about what they know.
Working for a "micromanager" would be torture.
Their motivation comes from inside; they are self-starters.
Employees with an Internal Pattern work best with little supervision.
"It looks okay to me.
And they want more for less.
"Prove it," they insist (to their satisfaction).
You be the judge." Great language for Internals.
Let's say you want to book a hotel in Paris.
We can use the LAB Profile® to explain this.
I notice a problem myself - Internal and Away From.
My mother broke her wrist during an icy winter.
They need to know who else has bought.
This entails establishing credibility as well as rapport.
Appearance also counts.
Why do people buy Jaguars?
Because the leather seats are comfortable?
Then he stopped and thought.
Closet External in action!
He stuck to his own inclination to bring them home.
What do you think?
"What do you think?
How does a person reason?
There is always another better way to do things.
They are thrilled by unlimited possibilities and ideas.
However, they do not necessarily feel compelled to finish it.
They believe there is a "right" way to do things.
A procedure has a beginning and an end.
This category deals with Distortion.
After a while I became dissatisfied.
And being organized is important to me.
They are just thinking about their dreams.
They want to know why they should buy.
As I left, I inadvertently used an irresistible Pattern.
She said: "You're right.
There's gotta be a way.
Then you can look at them.
You can then decide which one suits you best.
Others are thrilled.
I know; I have tried.
They have a procedure for doing everything.
Is it setup and development, or maintenance?
They target the wrong people.
This is Options language.
They need to follow a process; a Procedure.
The reason for this is simple.
Sales involves being Proactive and mainly following a procedure.
That's a procedure.
And they often "forget" to follow up.
Certain kinds of jobs are inherently Options or Procedures.
Piloting an airplane, for example, is quite clearly a procedure.
I learned much from him about creative seminar design.
You can see the conflict between Options and Procedures.
They wait for customers!
They are people with an Options preference.
Who teaches in the nursing schools?
What are hospitals all about?
Procedures, and often very tight ones with little choice.
There are an expanding number of private nursing services.
Let's take software design and marketing, for example.
You develop and design software.
What do design engineers do?
They create systems and design products.
What does the plant do?
It makes them.
Production managers get furious when Engineering keeps changing the specs.
I'm speaking about myself here, of course!
Creators and users of technology approach technology quite differently.
Options TV/Netflix/Prime/YouTube etc., watchers often flit from program to program.
Jerry Seinfeld said: "Men don't care what's on TV.
They only care what else is on TV"[22] .
They feel comfortable doing the same thing over and over.
Let them know how important the finished result is.
You can use the Influencing Language for both Patterns.
Imagine that for a moment.
They get things done.
Just tell me one way.
The right way!" I needed the procedure to follow.
Don't give them options, choices or alternatives at the beginning.
The group seemed frustrated and wanted to continue.
I said, "Okay, well there are some options.
What would you prefer?" Everybody went um, ah, um.
I said "I have a suggestion.
Let's break for lunch now.
Not deprivation, overload.
Too much choice.
A step by step process is more helpful for them.
Options: Compelled to develop and create systems and procedures.
Have difficulty following set procedures.
Procedures: Prefer to follow tried-and-true set ways.
Get stumped when they have no procedures to follow.
Are you motivated by evolution, revolution, both, or stability?
They do not like change and may refuse to adapt.
They prefer their situations to evolve slowly over time.
They need major change once every five to seven years.
They will resist static or stable situations.
They like change to be revolutionary, dramatically different.
They are happy with both revolution and evolution.
The question asks: "What is the relationship between .
I profiled a man in several Contexts.
Guess what Pattern they have?
I was itching to move.
She adopted three children from different backgrounds.
She wanted to read something different.
She has since completed her Ph.D.
and changed jobs twice in 3 years.
How can this work in a marriage?
Does the job require a great number of different tasks?
How long does each task remain the same?
How much of each?
I tried the company where he had been working.
He had, of course, left and gone somewhere else.
I asked him in how many schools had he worked.
He had been in seventeen different schools.
Many jobs need someone who can build and progress.
A fewer number of positions actually require revolutionaries.
Some professions naturally attract people with certain preferences.
They will feel stressed if placed in high-change environments.
For some companies, this happens frequently anyway.
Then a miracle occurred.
Word processors were invented.
I can't do this.
Forget the word new.
Forget the word revolution.
They have the same keyboard.
Many introduced "Continuous Improvement" programs.
They were not called "Dramatic Difference" programs.
But this lesson needs to be relearned over and over.
Here's an old but very telling marketing fiasco.
However, they could not have tested the name.
But this was the soft drink Context.
Apparently, not very many.
Coca Cola responded and returned old Coke to the market.
They called it Coke Classic, which is Sameness language.
Labatt Blue, a Canadian beer, apparently understood the Pattern.
It must look, sound, and feel like old reliable.
How about: "Remember when you .
That means being Different somehow.
This Difference Pattern is essential.
End-users tend to have a Sameness and Procedures combination.
(As I do when it comes to software.
Sameness: They like things to stay the same.
They will provoke change only every 15 to 25 years.
Sameness with Exception: They prefer situations to evolve over time.
They want major change about every 5 to 7 years.
Difference: They want change to be constant and drastic.
They will initiate change every 1 to 2 years.
Major change averages every 3 to 4 years.
The big picture or specific details?
At the extreme, they cannot perceive or create an overview.
They may have difficulty prioritizing as a result.
With a Specific person, the interview will be much longer.
There are no questions for this category.
George and I met with Mr.
George and I met with Mr.
Here are some examples.
"I didn't really choose this kind of work.
I didn't have a job when this one came up.
I applied and got it." Procedures, mainly General.
Here is an example of Procedures with Mainly Specific.
I get to work with people.
Different kinds of people.
Several things can happen: 1.
So, what is the cure?
There are several options.
For the General person, give them the big picture.
People and project management tend to be mainly General functions.
But they have machines for that now!
They can attend to any level or the whole thing.
the big picture.
I also had an employee once who did this too.
Bids must contain a lot of detail.
The answer was: 42.
It can take time to help someone with this issue.
That is Away From motivation.
Look at the people listening, do they look confused?
Do they appear to want more from you?
You can ask if they would like more information?
About which part?
It's useful to notice the response you are getting!
Do they want more?
Do they look bored or want to leave?
Summary Scope Question: There is no question for this category.
Specific: Deals with details and sequences.
Cannot see the overview.
General: Prefers the overview, big picture.
Can handle details for short periods.
They respond based on what they consider to be appropriate.
People with this Pattern simply do not pick up hints.
Self people will not pick it up.
You can recognize those people when you drop the pencil.
It is not spontaneous, not a reflex.
A reflex action is something outside of voluntary control.
Examples There are no word examples for this category.
You would have had to ask for it.
Self people do well where technical expertise is required.
Once a Self, Always a Self?
Remember Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory television program?
Be totally rigorous in what you say.
Define your terms properly.
Self: Attends to own experience.
Doesn't notice nonverbal behavior or voice tone.
Other: Has Automatic reflex responses to nonverbal behavior.
Other: They are influenced by the depth of rapport.

People will instinctively agree or correct what you have said.
Listen for examples of the Pattern language in their example.
I have the impression that you ....

what motivates you is ...
They are Internal with regards to whom?
What Criteria motivate them?
Do they need to follow a Procedure or explore Options?
Do they focus on tasks or relationships at work?
(Internal, Options and Away From).
(External, Procedures, Toward).
Briefly review the behaviors associated with each separate Pattern, 2.

Maybe, or maybe not.
What does one need to do to change a habit?
(Procedure and Sameness).

How many Patterns can you find in the sentence above?
Is there a process (Procedure)?
The Language of Suggestion vs.
There are 4 steps: 1.
State what problem it avoids or solves (Away From) 3.
State the benefit (Toward) 4.
Then I'm going to tell you.
I adapted the 4Mat System from Bernice McCarthy's work[41].
Why your topic is important to your audience.
(Options, Away From and/or Toward) 2.
What is the topic/content (Thing) 3.
How - the steps (Procedures) 4.
(what) It has 4 steps.
Why - either Toward or Away From 2.
What - in language for Internals or Externals 3.
How - choices (Options) or steps (Procedures) 4.

I am telling them what to do, 3.
They have a problem and I have the solution, 4.
They are not perfect in some way, and/or 5.
I am better than they are in some way.
You may wish to rephrase as follows: 1.
As you probably know....
Use the language of suggestion: You may wish to consider...

The steps in the Conversational Coaching© Process are: 1.
Get in state 2.
Establish framework: Rapport and Credibility 3.
Get permission and anchor resources 4.
Agree on "problem" and outcome 5.
Present State - Desired State in LAB Profile® Patterns 6.
Ecology Check and Sanity Check 8.
Rapport and credibility 2.
Anchor resources 3.
Agree on "problem" and outcome 4.
Intervention (any developmental process) 5.
Ecology Check 6.
Get their permission to work with them, make suggestions, etc.
An open mind yields better results!
what would you think about....?
Use such phrases as: (person) ...
Rapport is more important to them than credibility.
How does it reflect who you want to be?
ECOLOGY your objective respects the whole system you function in.
What do you risk losing?

Sameness w Ex?
decide by oneself, hold standards / adapt to feedback (InternalExternal)?
follow procedures / design them (Procedures-Options)?
big picture / detail (General-Specific)?
rapport with others (Other, Choice)?

Let's look at the team as a whole.
How can you maximize these strengths?
I continue to help them with hiring new staff.
That is what I taught them how to do.
I trained them in the LAB Profile® Strategies for Negotiations.
We ran role plays, simulating actual negotiations.
What followed was very interesting.
But the strategy worked.
Everyone realized it was an excellent deal.
Fairness is a word one hears often in this Context.
It is a Sameness word.
Fair usually means the same treatment for everyone.
Forget about suggesting options.
They hired me to conduct LAB Profile® market research.
Their closing rate increased by 50%.

In the end he stayed the full 10 days.
He really wanted to learn.
You can do it by phoning your sample group.
The drug was not approved for use in the end.
This knowledge can help you write ads, taglines etc.
Here is a summary of our findings.
Reason (Options-Procedures): The ads represented both Options and Procedures.
We also demonstrated a startling fact for our client.
He now works for a competitor, in a different city.
But people have to CARE!
That's why the Person element is so important.
Why are educational programs designed the way they are?
You can get them to evaluate their own work.
Adult Learners Learning is a Context in and of itself.
(Stories have a beginning, a middle and the end....
Stories are a combination of Procedure and Person.
They decide with each idea or sentence.
They end up just laughing because everybody else is laughing.
It looks like Mr.
Joker has just pulled the rug outfrom under her feet.
Some people may even start feeling sorry for her!
But Aruna didn't make this mistake.
And she was brilliant!

This park is located near Mt.
Kilimanjaro on both the Kenyan and Tanzanian borders.
The mountain is undoubtedly the highest point in Africa.
This natural habitat derived its name from the lake.
There are also birdlife such as eagles, herons, and vultures.
Additional national parks and resorts have been discussed below.
The Meru National Park is a natural habitat.
The accompanying resorts are positioned along the equatorial region.
It hosts crocodile and elephants alongside other rare animal species.
The latter are a home to lions, zebras and rhinos.
Some of the conservancies include the Olare Motorogi and Naboisho.
Generally, wildlife has vast space for reproduction and habitation.
Huge hunting safaris were undertaken by these visitors.
In the process, wildlife was slaughtered in mass numbers.
Consequently, additional protected areas were established.
About 12 months later, the Nairobi Royal Park was incepted.
These goals are presumably not within the protected areas.
The following section will discuss these challenges in details.
Several types of fish species have consequently been endangered.
Hence, road transport can hardly be used in such locations.
Undoubtedly, a weak security platform is may scare tourists.
They assert that the world is experiencing variability in climate.
Excessive evaporation eventually leads to heavy condensation and precipitation.
Tourist resorts are vital facilities in national parks.
This type of resort has enough capabilities to accommodate visitors.
This is yet another challenge facing national habituates in Kenya.
This condition is sometimes accompanied by rapid spread of infections.
How can National parks in Kenya transfer to successful businesses?
This type of resort has enough capabilities to accommodate visitors.
these resorts are not merely places of accommodation.
Some Kenyan national parks also lack sufficient road network.
The tourism sector is quite dynamic.
For example, Ksh.
It stimulates cross cultural understanding across various cultures.
Unique water sports include fishing and whitewater rafting.
Nu human input is required to create wildlife.
We received and encountered more than we expected.
When natural resources are scarce, conflicts usually arise.
The result is the conflict between the two.
Out of these tribes, about five are the most dominant.
Research evidence indicates that globalization overrides trade barriers.

The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats.
Winston made for the stairs.
It was no use trying the lift.
BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.
Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold.
The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner.
There was one on the house-front immediately opposite.
It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows.
Only the Thought Police mattered.
The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously.
Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen.
The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war.
The Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order.
Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.
The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one.
There were no windows in it at all.
Winston turned round abruptly.
He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen.
With the next he was more successful.
It was a peculiarly beautiful book.
He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase.
A tremor had gone through his bowels.
To mark the paper was the decisive act.
In small clumsy letters he wrote: April 4th, 1984.
He sat back.
A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him.
For the future, for the unborn.
How could you communicate with the future?
It was of its nature impossible.
For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper.
The telescreen had changed over to strident military music.
The actual writing would be easy.
At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up.
Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably.
The seconds were ticking by.
Last night to the flicks.
All war films.
He knew the reason.
That, it was true, was very unlikely.
Something in his face suggested it irresistibly.
The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.
The Hate had started.
There were hisses here and there among the audience.
Winston's diaphragm was constricted.
The Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be.
It was a book without a title.
But one knew of such things only through vague rumours.
In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy.
Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed.
The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out 'Swine!
Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary.
Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.
He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon.
The Hate rose to its climax.
Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying.
Then she buried her face in her hands.
It was apparent that she was uttering a prayer.
Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold.
Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye.
O'Brien had stood up.
An unmistakable message had passed.
'I know precisely what you are feeling.
I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust.
Such incidents never had any sequel.
Some days he believed in it, some days not.
It was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything.
Winston roused himself and sat up straighter.
He let out a belch.
The gin was rising from his stomach.
His eyes re-focused on the page.
He could not help feeling a twinge of panic.
The Thought Police would get him just the same.
Thoughtcrime, they called it.
It was always at night—the arrests invariably happened at night.
People simply disappeared, always during the night.
You were abolished, annihilated: VAPORIZED was the usual word.
The next moment he started violently.
There was a knocking at the door.
But no, the knocking was repeated.
The worst thing of all would be to delay.
He got up and moved heavily towards the door.
It was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done.
He drew in his breath and opened the door.
Instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through him.
Winston followed her down the passage.
These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation.
'They haven't been out today.
Winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint of the pipe.
Mrs Parsons looked on helplessly.
'He loves anything like that.
'A spanner,' said Mrs Parsons, immediately becoming invertebrate.
'I don't know, I'm sure.
Mrs Parsons brought the spanner.
'Up with your hands!' yelled a savage voice.
'You're a traitor!' yelled the boy.
'You're a thought-criminal!
You're a Eurasian spy!
'They do get so noisy,' she said.
I'm too busy to take them.
'Want to see the hanging!
Children always clamoured to be taken to see it.
The music from the telescreen had stopped.
Nearly all children nowadays were horrible.
The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off.
Suddenly he began thinking of O'Brien again.
Years ago—how long was it?
He had walked on without pausing.
But at any rate the identification existed.
Nor did it even seem to matter greatly.
The voice continued raspingly: 'Attention!
Your attention, please!
A newsflash has this moment arrived from the Malabar front.
Our forces in South India have won a glorious victory.
Here is the newsflash— —' Bad news coming, thought Winston.
Winston belched again.
The gin was wearing off, leaving a deflated feeling.
You were supposed to stand to attention.
However, in his present position he was invisible.
'Oceania, 'tis for thee' gave way to lighter music.
The day was still cold and clear.
The sacred principles of Ingsoc.
Newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past.
He was alone.
The past was dead, the future was unimaginable.
Even from the coin the eyes pursued you.
Always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you.
His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape.
It was too strong, it could not be stormed.
A thousand rocket bombs would not batter it down.
He wondered again for whom he was writing the diary.
The telescreen struck fourteen.
He must leave in ten minutes.
He had to be back at work by fourteen-thirty.
36 1984 He was already dead, he reflected.
He wrote: Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.
Two fingers of his right hand were inkstained.
He put the diary away in the drawer.
A hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious.
Both of them were looking up at him.
Such things, he saw, could not happen today.
In his waking thoughts he called it the Golden Country.
That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time.
Winston woke up with the word 'Shakespeare' on his lips.
The Physical Jerks would begin in three minutes.
'Thirty to forty group!' yapped a piercing female voice.
'Thirty to forty group!
Take your places, please.
'Arms bending and stretching!' she rapped out.
'Take your time by me.
ONE, two, three, four!
ONE, two, three, four!
Come on, comrades, put a bit of life into it!
ONE, two, three four!
It was extraordinarily difficult.
Beyond the late fifties everything faded.
Everything had been different then.
He reeked of gin.
I said so, Ma, didn't I?
That's what comes of trusting 'em.
I said so all along.
Officially the change of partners had never happened.
But where did that knowledge exist?
Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting.
It was quite simple.
'Reality control', they called it: in Newspeak, 'doublethink'.
'Stand easy!' barked the instructress, a little more genially.
His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink.
The instructress had called them to attention again.
'Right over from the hips, please, comrades.
The half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations.
Everything melted into mist.
He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood.
But you could prove nothing.
There was never any evidence.
'6079 Smith W.!
Bend lower, please!
You can do better than that.
You're not trying.
THAT'S better, comrade.
His face remained completely inscrutable.
Never show dismay!
Never show resentment!
A single flicker of the eyes could give you away.
THAT'S how I want to see you doing it.
Watch me again.
I'm thirty-nine and I've had four children.
Now look.' She bent over again.
'Anyone under forty-five is perfectly capable of touching his toes.
Remember our boys on the Malabar front!
And the sailors in the Floating Fortresses!
Just think what THEY have to put up with.
Now try again.
In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices.
This last was for the disposal of waste paper.
For some reason they were nicknamed memory holes.
The actual output was given as sixty-two millions.
Very likely no boots had been produced at all.
Winston glanced across the hall.
Winston's greatest pleasure in life was in his work.
Winston was good at this kind of thing.
He unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier.
Winston read through the offending article.
In some cases they might not even be dead.
Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip.
It was perfectly possible.
Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced.
Perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence.
Withers, however, was already an UNPERSON.
He did not exist: he had never existed.
What was needed was a piece of pure fantasy.
Today he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy.
At twen- 60 1984 ty-three he had perished in action.
Comrade Ogilvy, unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact.
The room was already very full and deafeningly noisy.
He turned round.
Perhaps 'friend' was not exactly the right word.
Syme was a philologist, a specialist in Newspeak.
'Not one!' said Winston with a sort of guilty haste.
There had been a famine of them for months past.
The queue gave another jerk forward.
As they halted he turned and faced Syme again.
'I was working,' said Winston indifferently.
His mocking eyes roved over Winston's face.
'It was a good hanging,' said Syme reminiscently.
I like to see them kicking.
Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille.
'There's a table over there, under that telescreen,' said Syme.
'Slowly,' said Syme.
'I'm on the adjectives.
'The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition,' he said.
But not a bit of it!
We're destroying words—scores of them, hundreds of them, every day.
We're cutting the language down to the bone.
'It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words.
It isn't only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms.
A word contains its opposite in itself.
Take 'good', for instance.
Of course we use those forms already.
Don't you see the beauty of that, Winston?
Nevertheless Syme immediately detected a certain lack of enthusiasm.
'Even when you write it you're still thinking in Oldspeak.
They're good enough, but they're translations.
He smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not trusting himself to speak.
It's merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control.
The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect.
Syme, however, had divined what he was about to say.
'The proles are not human beings,' he said carelessly.
'By 2050—earlier, probably—all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared.
The whole literature of the past will have been destroyed.
Even the literature of the Party will change.
Even the slogans will change.
The whole climate of thought will be different.
Orthodoxy means not thinking—not needing to think.
He is too intelligent.
He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly.
The Party does not like such people.
One day he will disappear.
It is written in his face.
Winston had finished his bread and cheese.
For the rest it was just a noise, a quack-quack-quacking.
There was something subtly wrong with Syme.
You could not say that he was unorthodox.
Yet a faint air of disreputability always clung to him.
Syme's fate was not difficult to foresee.
Zeal was not enough.
Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.
Syme looked up.
'Here comes Parsons,' he said.
Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face.
His powers of sweating were extraordinary.
What's that you've got there, old boy?
Something a bit too brainy for me, I expect.
Smith, old boy, I'll tell you why I'm chasing you.
'For Hate Week.
You know—the house-by-house fund.
I'm treasurer for our block.
'By the way, old boy,' he said.
I gave him a good dressing-down for it.
But here's the point, old boy.
So the chances were he was a foreigner.
'Ah, that I couldn't say, of course.
'Comrades!' cried an eager youthful voice.
We have glorious news for you.
We have won the battle for production!
Here are some of the completed figures.
Foodstuffs——' The phrase 'our new, happy life' recurred several times.
Yes, they swallowed it.
Parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal.
Was he, then, ALONE in the possession of a memory?
The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen.
He meditated resentfully on the physical texture of life.
Had it always been like this?
Had food always tasted like this?
He looked round the canteen.
He looked round the canteen again.
Mrs Parsons would be vaporized.
Syme would be vaporized.
Winston would be vaporized.
O'Brien would be vaporized.
Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized.
It was the girl with dark hair.
The instant she caught his eye she looked away again.
The sweat started out on Winston's backbone.
A horrible pang of terror went through him.
Why was she watching him?
Why did she keep following him about?
The smallest thing could give you away.
The girl had turned her back on him again.
Parsons had begun talking again.
Burned her quite badly, I believe.
Little beggars, eh?
But 80 1984 keen as mustard!
Ear trumpets for listening through keyholes!
Of course it's only a toy, mind you.
It was the signal to return to work.
She had a young face, painted very thick.
Party women never paint their faces.
There was nobody else in the street, and no telescreens.
She said two dollars.
Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system.
She—— His teeth were set on edge.
He would have liked to spit.
Only the proles used scent.
It was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter.
The unforgivable crime was promiscuity between Party members.
He thought again of Katharine.
It was curious how seldom he thought of her.
They had only been together for about fifteen months.
'The human sound-track' he nicknamed her in his own mind.
To embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image.
The rigidlty of her muscles managed to convey that impression.
It was extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible.
But curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this.
They must, she said, produce a child if they could.
She had two names for it.
Winston sighed inaudibly.
Why did it always have to be like this?
But a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event.
The women of the Party were all alike.
Chastity was as deep ingrained in them as Party loyalty.
The sexual act, successfully performed, was rebellion.
Desire was thoughtcrime.
He wrote: I turned up the lamp.
For the first time he could see the woman properly.
She had no teeth at all.
But I went ahead and did it just the same.
He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again.
The therapy had not worked.
The Party could not be overthrown from within.
would have no need to conspire.
His heart had leapt.
It's start- 90 1984 ed!
he had thought.
The proles are breaking loose at last!
Now the supply had unexpectedly given out.
There was a fresh outburst of yells.
Winston watched them disgustedly.
In reality very little was known about the proles.
It was not necessary to know much.
To keep them in control was not difficult.
The larger evils invariably escaped their notice.
Even the civil police interfered with them very little.
Promiscuity went unpunished, divorce was permitted.
They were beneath suspicion.
It had begun itching again.
These rich men were called capitalists.
How could you tell how much of it was lies?
He reached down and scratched his ankle again.
It was like a single equation with two unknowns.
Everything faded into mist.
It was the lonely hour of fifteen.
The place was almost empty.
A tinny music was trickling from the telescreens.
Uncommanded, the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin.
There came into it—but it was something hard to describe.
A little later all three were re-arrested.
There was only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies.
Of course, this was not in itself a discovery.
He had gone straight on working.
Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes.
That was ten—eleven years ago.
Today, probably, he would have kept that photograph.
The past not only changed, but changed continuously.
Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one.
The hypnotic eyes gazed into his own.
The heresy of heresies was common sense.
Or that the force of gravity works?
Or that the past is unchangeable?
His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord.
It was their final, most essential command.
And yet he was in the right!
They were wrong and he was right.
Truisms are true, hold on to that!
The solid world exists, its laws do not change.
If that is granted, all else follows.
Winston paused involuntarily.
Winston caught scraps of conversation as he approached.
That's jest where it is.' The strident voices stopped abruptly.
'May I see your papers, comrade?
What are you doing here?
What time did you leave work?
Suddenly the whole street was in commotion.
There were yells of warning from all sides.
People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits.
'Steamer!' he yelled.
'Look out, guv'nor!
Winston promptly flung himself on his face.
Winston clasped his forearms above his head.
He walked on.
'Can't you bleeding well listen to what I say?
I takes 'em down reg'lar as the clock.
I could pretty near tell you the bleeding number.
Four oh seven, it ended in.
It were in February—second week in February.' 'February your grandmother!
I got it all down in black and white.
They were talking about the Lottery.
Winston looked back when he had gone thirty metres.
They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces.
But if there was hope, it lay in the proles.
You had to cling on to that.
The street into which he had turned ran downhill.
From somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices.
At this moment Winston remembered where he was.
What was it like in those days?
It was madness of course.
''Ark at 'im!
'Litre and half litre—that's all we serve.
The old man's whitestubbled face had flushed pink.
He turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston.
Winston caught him gently by the arm.
'May I offer you a drink?' he said.
'You're a gent,' said the other, straightening his shoulders again.
He appeared not to have noticed Winston's blue overalls.
'Pint!' he added aggressively to the barman.
Winston's presence was forgotten for a moment.
'A 'alf litre ain't enough.
It Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 113 don't satisfy.
And a 'ole litre's too much.
It starts my bladder running.
'The beer was better,' he said finally.
'It's all wars,' said the old man vaguely.
He took up his glass, and his shoulders straightened again.
'You are very much older than I am,' said Winston.
I should like your opinion on that.
Half of them hadn't even boots on their feet.
They owned everything that there was to own.
'Top 'ats!' he said.
'Funny you should mention 'em.
Gorn right out, they 'ave.
Everything existed for their benefit.
You—the ordinary people, the workers—were their slaves.
They could do what they liked with you.
They could ship you off to Canada like cattle.
They could sleep with your daughters if they chose.
'Lackeys!' he said.
That reg'lar takes me back, that does.
Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews, Indians—all sorts there was.
'E didn't 'alf give it 'em!
'Lackeys!' 'e says, 'lackeys of the bourgeoisie!
And 'yenas—'e definitely called 'em 'yenas.
'What I really wanted to know was this,' he said.
Are you treated more like a human being?
'The House of Lords, if you like.
'Yes,' he said.
'They liked you to touch your cap to 'em.
116 1984 It showed respect, like.
'I recollect it as if it was yesterday.
Quite a gent, 'e was—dress shirt, top 'at, black overcoat.
He made a last attempt.
'Perhaps I have not made myself clear,' he said.
'What I'm trying to say is this.
In 1925, for instance, you were already grown up.
He finished up his beer, more slowly than before.
'I know what you expect me to say,' he said.
You got your 'ealth and strength when you're young.
You ain't got the same worries.
No truck with women, and that's a great thing.
It was no use going on.
The extra half-litre was already working on him.
At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly.
He halted and looked up.
He seemed to know the place.
A twinge of fear went through him.
'I recognized you on the pavement,' he said immediately.
'You're the gentleman that bought the young lady's keepsake album.
That was a beautiful bit of paper, that was.
Creamlaid, it used to be called.
'Is there anything special I can do for you?
'I just looked in.
Between you and me, the antique trade's just about finished.
No demand any longer, and no stock either.
Furniture, china, glass it's all been broken up by degrees.
And of course the metal stuff's mostly been melted down.
'What is it?' said Winston, fascinated.
'That's coral, that is,' said the old man.
'It must have come from the Indian Ocean.
They used to kind of embed it in the glass.
That wasn't made less than a hundred years ago.
'It is a beautiful thing,' said the other appreciatively.
'But there's not many that'd say so nowadays.' He coughed.
'There's not much in it.
Just a few pieces.
'I'm selling the furniture off by little and little.
'There's no telescreen!' he could not help murmuring.
Now that's a nice gateleg table in the corner there.
It contained nothing but rubbish.
Winston came across to examine the picture.
Winston gazed at it for some moments.
'It's a ruin now.
Outside the Law Courts.
It was bombed in— oh, many years ago.
It was just names of churches.
'I never knew it had been a church,' he said.
Now, how did that rhyme go?
I've got it!
That's still standing.
It's in Victory Square, alongside the picture gallery.
Yes, he thought again, he would come back.
He would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish.
For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move.
At any rate, one question was settled.
It was too great a coincidence.
It was enough that she was watching him.
It was an effort to walk.
The worst thing was the pain in his belly.
Then the spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.
The street was a blind alley.
He could not run, he could not strike a blow.
Besides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself.
But that too was impossible.
A deadly lassitude had taken hold of him.
But he did not open it at once.
Undoubtedly some people did so.
Many of the disappearances were actually suicides.
He opened the diary.
It was important to write something down.
The woman on the telescreen had started a new song.
It would not matter if they killed you at once.
To be killed was what you expected.
Nobody ever escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess.
He knew what it meant, or thought he knew.
He put a cigarette in his mouth.
It was the girl with dark hair.
It was a common accident in the Fiction Department.
A sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her.
She must have fallen right on the injured arm.
Winston stopped short.
The girl had risen to her knees.
A curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart.
'You're hurt?' he said.
She had certainly turned very pale.
'You haven't broken anything?' 'No, I'm all right.
'It's nothing,' she repeated shortly.
'I only gave my wrist a bit of a bang.
There was no question that she had done it intentionally.
It was something small and flat.
It was a scrap of paper folded into a square.
But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew.
So far as he could see there were two possibilities.
Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all!
Perhaps the girl was part of it!
Eight minutes had gone by.
He flattened it out.
Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled canteen was torment.
The afternoon was more bearable.
Tonight was one of his nights at the Community Centre.
But the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous.
Whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced you.
Actually, few people ever wrote letters.
Finally he decided that the safest place was the canteen.
They passed each other without a glance.
He did not touch the diary during those days.
There was no enquiry he could make.
The next day she reappeared.
It was early, and the place was not very full.
She was perhaps three metres away from him.
Another two seconds would do it.
'Smith!' repeated the voice, more loudly.
It was no use.
He turned round.
It was not safe to refuse.
It was too noticeable.
He sat down with a friendly smile.
The silly blond face beamed into his.
The girl's table filled up a few minutes later.
Next day he took care to arrive early.
His hopes sank again.
With ice at his heart Winston followed.
At this moment there was a tremendous crash.
But it was all right.
He did not look at her.
He unpacked his tray and promptly began eating.
There was perhaps a minute in which to act.
Both Winston and the girl were eating steadily.
In a low murmur Winston began speaking.
And don't look at me.
Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time.
Again the terrible fear seized upon Winston.
She was not coming, she had changed her mind!
There were telescreens all round the pediment.
Suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square.
He was next to the girl.
Truck-load after truck-load of the sad faces passed.
You'll have to remember this.
'Can you remember all that?' she murmured finally.
And the gate's got no top bar.' 'Yes.
What time?' 'About fifteen.
You may have to wait.
I'll get there by another way.
The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity.
The convoy was drawing to an end.
He had time to learn every detail of her hand.
The air seemed to kiss one's skin.
It was the second of May.
He was a bit early.
Presumably she could be trusted to find a safe place.
He went on picking bluebells.
It was the best thing to do.
To look round was to show guilt.
He picked another and another.
A hand fell lightly on his shoulder.
He looked up.
It was the girl.
Winston followed, still clasping his bunch of flowers.
The girl stopped and turned.
'Here we are,' she said.
He was facing her at several paces' distance.
As yet he did not dare move nearer to her.
I don't suppose there is, but there could be.
'We're all right here?' he repeated stupidly.
'There's nothing big enough to hide a mike in.
Besides, I've been here before.' They were only making conversation.
The bluebells had cascaded on to the ground.
They seemed to have fallen of their own accord.
He took her hand.
I've got a wife that I can't get rid of.
I've got varicose veins.
At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity.
All he felt was incredulity and pride.
She sat against him, putting her arm round his waist.
'Never mind, dear.
There's no hurry.
We've got the whole afternoon.
Isn't this a splendid hide-out?
I know yours.
'I hated the sight of you,' he said.
'I wanted to rape you and then murder you afterwards.
'Not the Thought Police!
You didn't honestly think that?' 'Well, perhaps not exactly that.
Pure in word and deed.
Banners, processions, slogans, games, community hikes all that stuff.
'Where did you get this stuff?' he said.
'Black market,' she said indifferently.
'Actually I am that sort of girl, to look at.
I'm good at games.
I was a troop-leader in the Spies.
I always Iook cheerful and I never shirk anything.
Always yell with the crowd, that's what I say.
The taste was delightful.
'You are very young,' he said.
'You are ten or fifteen years younger than I am.
I thought I'd take a chance.
I'm good at spotting people who don't belong.
He did not dislike it.
They did not speak above a whisper.
Presently they had reached the edge of the little wood.
She stopped him.
'Don't go out into the open.
There might be someone watching.
He knew it by sight.
'Isn't there a stream somewhere near here?' he whispered.
'That's right, there is a stream.
It's at the edge of the next field, actually.
There are fish in it, great big ones.
'The Golden Country?' 'It's nothing, really.
Perhaps it had not seen them.
It was in the sun, they in the shade.
In the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling.
Winston and Julia clung together, fascinated.
Winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence.
For whom, for what, was that bird singing?
No mate, no rival was watching it.
He stopped thinking and merely felt.
Winston put his lips against her ear.
'NOW,' he whispered.
'Not here,' she whispered back.
'Come back to the hideout.
it was almost as in his dream.
Her body gleamed white in the sun.
'Have you done this before?' 'Of course.
Anything to rot, to weaken, to undermine!
The more men you've had, the more I love you.
I don't want any virtue to exist anywhere.
I'm corrupt to the bones.' 'You like doing this?
This time there was no difficulty.
The sun seemed to have grown hotter.
They were both sleepy.
Winston woke first.
Except for her mouth, you could not call her beautiful.
The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft.
Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory.
It was a blow struck against the Party.
It was a political act.
'It's generally safe to use any hide-out twice.
It seemed natural to leave this to her.
'I'm due back at nineteen-thirty.
Isn't it bloody?
Give me a brushdown, would you?
Have I got any twigs in my hair?
Are you sure?
A rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand.
Even her lips were white.
She was dead!
Both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster.
Julia, in any case, seldom had an evening completely free.
It paid, she said, it was camouflage.
It was a blazing afternoon.
Julia was twenty-six years old.
But she was not interested in the finished product.
She 'didn't much care for reading,' she said.
She had always borne an excellent character.
'What are these books like?' said Winston curiously.
'Oh, ghastly rubbish.
They're boring, really.
I was never in the Rewrite Squad.
'They don't even like having married women there,' she added.
Girls are always supposed to be so pure.
Here's one who isn't, anyway.
Life as she saw it was quite simple.
They did not discuss the possibility of getting married.
It was too remote to be worth thinking about.
It was hopeless even as a daydream.
'What was she like, your wife?' said Julia.
'She was—do you know the Newspeak word GOODTHINKFUL?
Sex talks once a month for the over-sixteens.
And in the Youth Movement.
They rub it into you for years.
I dare say it works in a lot of cases.
With Julia, everything came back to her own sexuality.
They can't bear you to feel like that.
Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine.
It was three or four months after they were married.
There was nobody of whom they could ask the way.
Look at those flowers.
That clump down near the bottom.
It was the hottest sleepiest hour of the afternoon.
And the thought struck him...
'Why didn't you give her a good shove?' said Julia.
'I would have.' 'Yes, dear, you would have.
He pulled her closer against him.
'Actually it would have made no difference,' he said.
In this game that we're playing, we can't win.
All you needed was luck and cunning and boldness.
'We are the dead,' he said.
Six months, a year—five years, conceivably.
I am afraid of death.
But it makes very little difference.
Which would you sooner sleep with, me or a skeleton?
Don't you enjoy being alive?
'Yes, I like that,' he said.
'Then stop talking about dying.
We've given it a good long rest.
I've got it all planned out.
The clock's hands said seventeen-twenty: it was nineteentwenty really.
She was coming at nineteen-thirty.
Folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious, gratuitous, suicidal folly.
Privacy, he said, was a very valuable thing.
Everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally.
Under the window somebody was singing.
They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!
The tune had been haunting London for weeks past.
Folly, folly, folly!
he thought again.
On the evening beforehand they met briefly in the street.
I can't come.' 'Why not?' 'Oh, the usual reason.
But after the second time it was different.
Both of them knew that it was lunacy.
Julia burst into the room.
'Half a second,' she said.
'Just let me show you what I've brought.
Did you bring some of that filthy Victory Coffee?
I thought you would.
Underneath were a number of neat paper packets.
'It isn't sugar?' he said.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 177 'Real sugar.
Not saccharine, sugar.
And here's a tin of milk—but look!
This is the one I'm really proud of.
'It's coffee,' he murmured, 'real coffee.' 'It's Inner Party coffee.
There's a whole kilo here,' she said.
There's nothing those swine don't have, nothing.
He tore open a corner of the packet.
'It's real tea.
They've captured India, or something,' she said vaguely.
'But listen, dear.
Go and sit on the other side of the bed.
Don't go too near the window.
She knew the whole drivelling song by heart, it seemed.
'You can turn round now,' said Julia.
What he had actually expected was to see her naked.
But she was not naked.
She had painted her face.
The improvement in her appearance was startling.
'Scent too!' he said.
'Yes, dear, scent too.
And do you know what I'm going to do next?
I'll wear silk stockings and high-heeled shoes!
Presently they fell asleep for a little while.
'Half that water's boiled away,' she said.
'I'll get up and make some coffee in another moment.
We've got an hour.
But you have to get in earlier than that, because—Hi!
'What was it?' he said in surprise.
There's a hole down there.
I gave him a good fright, anyway.' 'Rats!' murmured Winston.
'We've even got them in the kitchen at the hostel.
Some parts of London are swarming with them.
Did you know they attack children?
Yes, they do.
It's the great huge brown ones that do it.
You've gone quite pale.
What's the matter?
He did not reopen his eyes immediately.
It was always very much the same.
'I'm sorry,' he said, 'it's nothing.
'What is it, do you think?' said Julia.
That's what I like about it.
Two hundred, I dare say.
One can't tell.
'What is this place?
'Who taught you that?' he said.
I wonder what a lemon was,' she added inconsequently.
'I've seen oranges.
'They were quite common in the fifties.
I suppose it's almost time we were leaving.
I must start washing this paint off.
What a bore!
The room was darkening.
186 1984 Chapter 5 Syme had vanished.
On the next day nobody mentioned him.
It was enough.
Syme had ceased to exist: he had never existed.
The weather was baking hot.
Winston's evenings were fuller than ever.
A new poster had suddenly appeared all over London.
It did not seem to matter.
Dirty or clean, the room was paradise.
He seemed to have lost the need for it.
Mr Charrington, thought Winston, was another extinct animal.
He seemed glad of the opportunity to talk.
Often they gave themselves up to daydreams of escape.
Or they would commit suicide together.
It was all nonsense, as they both knew.
In reality there was no escape.
It frightened him a little.
But the issue still struck her as unimportant.
'Who cares?' she said impatiently.
Such things did not appear to horrify her.
It did not make much impression on her.
'Were they friends of yours?' she said.
'No, I never knew them.
They were Inner Party members.
Besides, they were far older men than I was.
'This was an exceptional case.
It wasn't just a question of somebody being killed.
History has stopped.
After the thing is done, no evidence ever remains.
But it was evidence.
By lack of understanding they remained sane.
198 1984 Chapter 6 I t had happened at last.
The expected message had come.
Winston stopped abruptly and turned.
It was O'Brien.
His heart bounded violently.
He would have been incapable of speaking.
'Hardly scholarly,' he said.
'I'm only an amateur.
It's not my Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 199 subject.
'That is not only my own opinion.
Any identifiable reference to him would have been mortally dangerous.
But they have only become so very recently.
'I didn't think it had been issued yet.
But a few advance copies have been circulated.
I have one myself.
'Some of the new developments are most ingenious.
'I am usually at home in the evenings,' he said.
There were no directories of any kind.
But at any rate, one thing was certain.
Perhaps tomorrow, perhaps after a long delay—he was not certain.
He had accepted it.
The end was contained in the beginning.
It was too complex to be put into words.
'I didn't murder her.
She seemed to have become completely spiritless.
Her large shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness.
The clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him.
One day a chocolate-ration was issued.
He remembered quite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate.
His mother told him not to be greedy.
Winston stood watching her for a moment.
'Winston, Winston!' his mother called after him.
His mother's anxious eyes were fixed on his face.
He never saw his mother again.
When he came back his mother had disappeared.
This was already becoming normal at that time.
He told Julia the story of his mother's disappearance.
'All children are swine.' 'Yes.
He would have liked to continue talking about his mother.
You were lifted clean out of the stream of history.
The proles had stayed human.
They had not become hardened inside.
'The proles are human beings,' he said aloud.
He thought for a little while.
You look normal and innocent.
I've thought it all out.
What you do, I'm going to do.
And don't be too downhearted.
At the end we're certain to be apart.
Do you realize how utterly alone we shall be?
We shall be utterly without power of any kind.
Everybody always confesses.
You can't help it.
They torture you.' 'I don't mean confessing.
Confession is not betrayal.
What you say or do doesn't matter: only feelings matter.
'They can't do that,' she said finally.
'It's the one thing they can't do.
They can't get inside you.
Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden.
That too was intimidating.
For perhaps twenty seconds he sat without stirring.
There was a sharp snap.
The voice had stopped.
'You can turn it off!' he said.
'Yes,' said O'Brien, 'we can turn it off.
We have that privilege.' He was opposite them now.
The seconds marched past, enormous.
'Shall I say it, or will you?' he said.
'I will say it,' said Winston promptly.
We want to join it and work for it.
We are enemies of the Party.
We disbelieve in the principles of Ingsoc.
We are thought-criminals.
We are also adulterers.
'Martin is one of us,' said O'Brien impassively.
'Bring the drinks over here, Martin.
Put them on the round table.
Have we enough chairs?
Bring a chair for yourself, Martin.
This is 216 1984 business.
Winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye.
It had a sour-sweet smell.
'It is called wine,' said O'Brien with a faint smile.
'You will have read about it in books, no doubt.
Wine was a thing he had read and dreamed about.
He set down the empty glass.
'Then there is such a person as Goldstein?' he said.
'Yes, there is such a person, and he is alive.
Where, I do not know.' 'And the conspiracy—the organization?
Is it real?
The Brotherhood, we call it.
You, comrade'—he bowed his head to Julia—'will leave first.
We have about twenty minutes at our disposal.
For a moment the lids flitted down over his eyes.
'No,' he said finally.
'You did well to tell me,' said O'Brien.
We may be obliged to give him a new identity.
And you yourself might have become a different person.
Our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition.
Sometimes it is necessary.
There were no scars that he could see.
She murmured something that seemed to be assent.
O'Brien looked at his wrist-watch again.
'I shall switch on in a quarter of an hour.
You will be seeing them again.
There was not a trace of friendliness in his manner.
You will always be in the dark.
When you receive orders, they will come from me.
When you are finally caught, you will confess.
That is unavoidable.
Probably you will not even betray me.
Even Julia 222 1984 seemed to be impressed.
No doubt you have formed your own picture of it.
Nothing of the kind exists.
No such list exists.
Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible.
You will get no comradeship and no encouragement.
When finally you are caught, you will get no help.
We never help our members.
Those are the only results that you will ever see.
We are the dead.
Our only true life is in the future.
It might be a thousand years.
We cannot act collectively.
'To the confusion of the Thought Police?
To the death of Big Brother?
To the future?' 'To the past,' said Winston.
'The past is more important,' agreed O'Brien gravely.
'There are details to be settled,' he said.
'That will do for the moment.
Later we will arrange something else for you.
It is important to change one's hiding-place frequently.
There are not many in existence, as you can imagine.
It makes very little difference.
The book is indestructible.
With two straps.' 'Black, two straps, very shabby—good.
O'Brien nodded without appearance of surprise.
Any question?.' Winston thought.
'Yes, I knew the last line.
His powerful grip crushed the bones of Winston's palm.
The incident was closed.
Gelatinous was the right word.
It had come into his head spontaneously.
All sensations seemed to be magnified.
He had worked more than ninety hours in five days.
So had everyone else in the Ministry.
Oceania was at war with Eastasia.
Eurasia was an ally.
The most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren.
He unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech.
Oceania was at war with Eastasia!
The next moment there was a tremendous commotion.
Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them.
It was sabotage!
The agents of Goldstein had been at work!
But within two or three minutes it was all over.
The entire staff of the Ministry had done likewise.
He was tired, but not sleepy any longer.
Julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was the book.
The print also looked slightly irregular.
The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable...
The sweet summer air played against his cheek.
It was bliss, it was etemity.
War has in fact changed its character.
Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still there.
If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction.
Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed.
In Newspeak there is no word for 'Science'.
The problem is the same for all three superstates.
Physical facts could not be ignored.
Efficiency, even military efficiency, is no longer needed.
Nothing is efficient in Oceania except the Thought Police.
But though it is unreal it is not meaningless.
The very word 'war', therefore, has become misleading.
Winston stopped reading for a moment.
Somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thundered.
The book fascinated him, or more exactly it reassured him.
'I've got THE BOOK,' he said as they disentangled themselves.
'Oh, you've got it?
'We must read it,' he said.
'Read it aloud.
That's the best way.
They had three or four hours ahead of them.
'Yes, my love, I'm listening.
The new Middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand.
Inequality was the price of civilization.
This last difference was cardinal.
The second danger, also, is only a theoretical one.
The problem, that is to say, is educational.
At the apex of the pyramid comes Big Brother.
Big Brother is infallible and all-powerful.
Nobody has ever seen Big Brother.
Below Big Brother comes the Inner Party.
In principle, membership of these three groups is not hereditary.
From the proletarians nothing is to be feared.
Nothing that he does is indifferent.
He has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever.
In Oceania there is no law.
CRIMESTOP, in short, means protective stupidity.
But stupidity is not enough.
The keyword here is BLACKWHITE.
Thus history is continuously rewritten.
In Oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, 'reality control'.
In no other way could the ancient cycle be broken.
It is; WHY should human equality be averted?
Here we reach the central secret.
As we have seen.
This motive really consists...
Her breast rose and fell slowly and regularly.
'Julia.' No answer.
'Julia, are you awake?' No answer.
She was asleep.
He had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret.
He understood HOW; he did not understand WHY.
He shut his eyes.
He was safe, everything was all right.
You still heard it all over the place.
It had outlived the Hate Song.
'I'm hungry,' she said.
'Let's make some more coffee.
I'm going to put my clothes on,' she added.
Why should the fruit be held inferior to the flower?
'She's beautiful,' he murmured.
'She's a metre across the hips, easily,' said Julia.
'That is her style of beauty,' said Winston.
He held Julia's supple waist easily encircled by his arm.
Out of their bodies no child would ever come.
That was the one thing they could never do.
He wondered how many children she had given birth to.
It might easily be fifteen.
At the end of it she was still singing.
If there was hope, it lay in the proles!
The future belonged to the proles.
Where there is equality there can be sanity.
In the end their awakening would come.
'He was singing to please himself.
Not even that.
He was just singing.' The birds sang, the proles sang.
the Party did not sing.
You were the dead, theirs was the future.
'We are the dead,' he said.
'We are the dead,' echoed Julia dutifully.
'You are the dead,' said an iron voice behind them.
They sprang apart.
Winston's entrails seemed to have turned into ice.
Her face had turned a milky yellow.
'You are the dead,' repeated the iron voice.
'It was behind the picture,' breathed Julia.
'It was behind the picture,' said the voice.
'Remain exactly where you are.
Unthinkable to disobey the iron voice from the wall.
'Now they can see us,' said Julia.
'Now we can see you,' said the voice.
'Stand out in the middle of the room.
Stand back to back.
Clasp your hands behind your heads.
Or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own.
The yard seemed to be full of men.
Something was being dragged across the stones.
The woman's singing had stopped abruptly.
'The house is surrounded,' said Winston.
280 1984 'The house is surrounded,' said the voice.
He heard Julia snap her teeth together.
'I suppose we may as well say good-bye,' she said.
'You may as well say good-bye,' said the voice.
Someone was climbing through the window.
There was a stampede of boots up the stairs.
Winston was not trembling any longer.
Even his eyes he barely moved.
Winston met his eyes.
There was another crash.
How small, thought Winston, how small it always was!
She was thrashing about on the floor, fighting for breath.
He stood dead still.
No one had hit him yet.
He wondered whether they had got Mr Charrington.
But the light seemed too strong.
But he did not pursue the thought further.
It was not interesting.
There ws another, lighter step in the passage.
Mr Charrington came into the room.
The demeanour of the black-uniformed men suddenly became more subdued.
Something had also changed in Mr Charrington's appearance.
His eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight.
'Pick up those pieces,' he said sharply.
A man stooped to obey.
Also he was not wearing his spectacles.
His body had straightened, and seemed to have grown bigger.
There were four telescreens, one in each wall.
There was a dull aching in his belly.
Since he was arrested he had not been fed.
He had already learned to sit still.
But the craving for food was growing upon him.
'Smith!' yelled a voice from the telescreen.
'6079 Smith W.!
It was a noisy, evilsmelling place.
All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals.
288 1984 'Beg pardon, dearie,' she said.
'Thass better,' she said, leaning back with closed eyes.
'Never keep it down, thass what I say.
'Wass your name, dearie?' she said.
'Smith,' said Winston.
'Smith?' said the woman.
My name's Smith too.
No one else had spoken to him.
When it grew better, panic took hold of him.
He hardly thought of Julia.
He could not fix his mind on her.
He thought oftener of O'Brien, with a flickering hope.
O'Brien might know that he had been arrested.
In the Ministry of Love there were no windows.
There was a sound of marching boots outside.
The steel door opened with a clang.
The poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell.
The door clanged shut again.
He had not yet noticed Winston's presence.
He was also several days away from a shave.
Winston roused hirnself a little from his lethargy.
'Ampleforth,' he said.
There was no yell from the telescreen.
Ampleforth paused, mildly startled.
His eyes focused themselves slowly on Winston.
'Ah, Smith!' he said.
'There is only one offence, is there not?' he said.
'These things happen,' he began vaguely.
'I have been able to recall one instance—a possible instance.
It was an indiscretion, undoubtedly.
'It was impossible to change the line.
The rhyme was 'rod”.
For days I had racked my brains.
Ampleforth looked startled again.
'I had hardly thought about it.
Winston sat quietly, his hands crossed.
Twenty minutes, an hour—it was difficult to judge.
Once more there was a sound of boots outside.
Winston's entrails contracted.
The door opened.
The cold-faced young officer stepped into the cell.
With a brief movement of the hand he indicated Ampleforth.
'Room 101,' he said.
What seemed like a long time passed.
The pain in Winston's belly had revived.
He had only six thoughts.
Parsons walked into the cell.
He was wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.
This time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.
'YOU here!' he said.
'What are you in for?' said Winston.
'Thoughtcrime!' said Parsons, almost blubbering.
I know they give you a fair hearing.
Oh, I trust them for that!
They'll know my record, won't they?
YOU know what kind of chap I was.
Not a bad chap in my way.
Not brainy, of course, but keen.
I'll get off with five years, don't you think?
Or even ten years?
'Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,' he said sententiously.
Do you know how it got hold of me?
In my sleep!
Yes, that's a fact.
And then I started talking in my sleep.
''Down with Big Brother!' Yes, I said that!
Said it over and over again, it seems.
'She listened at the keyhole.
Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?
I don't bear her any grudge for it.
In fact I'm proud of her.
Then he suddenly ripped down his shorts.
'Excuse me, old man,' he said.
'I can't help it.
Winston covered his face with his hands.
'Smith!' yelled the voice from the telescreen.
'6079 Smith W!
Uncover your face.
No faces covered in the cells.' Winston uncovered his face.
Parsons used the lavatory, loudly and abundantly.
Parsons was removed.
More prisoners came and went, 296 1984 mysteriously.
There were six prisoners in the cell, men and women.
All sat very still.
But what was startling was the emaciation of his face.
It was like a skull.
Suddenly he realized what was the matter.
The man was dying of starvation.
Presently he began to fidget on his seat.
There was a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen.
The chinless man jumped in his tracks.
'Bumstead!' roared the voice.
'2713 Bumstead J.!
'Remain standing where you are,' said the voice.
'Face the door.
Make no movement.' The chinless man obeyed.
His large pouchy cheeks were quivering uncontrollably.
The door clanged open.
The chinless man climbed back into his place.
Down one side of his face the flesh was darkening.
The door opened.
With a small gesture the officer indicated the skull-faced man.
'Room 101,' he said.
There was a gasp and a flurry at Winston's side.
Officer!' he cried.
'You don't have to take me to that place!
Haven't I told you everything already?
What else is it you want to know?
There's nothing I wouldn't confess, nothing!
Write it down and I'll sign it—anything!
Not room 101!' 'Room 101,' said the officer.
It was definitely, unmistakably, a shade of green.
'Do anything to me!' he yelled.
Finish it off and let me die.
Sentence me to twenty-five years.
Is there somebody else you want me to give away?
I've got a wife and three children.
The biggest of them isn't six years old.
But not Room 101!' 'Room 101,' said the officer.
He flung out a lean arm.
The man's voice rose to a shriek.
'You didn't hear him!' he repeated.
'Something went wrong with the telescreen.
HE'S the one you want.
He had set up a wordless howling, like an animal.
For perhaps twenty seconds they were hauling at him.
Then there was a different kind of cry.
They dragged him to his feet.
'Room 101,' said the officer.
A long time passed.
Winston was alone, and had been alone for hours.
His mouth was sticky and evil-tasting.
More dimly he thought of Julia.
She might be screaming with pain at this moment.
He did not feel it.
But that question was not answerable yet.
The boots were approaching again.
The door opened.
O'Brien came in.
Winston started to his feet.
'They've got you too!' he cried.
He stepped aside.
'You know this, Winston,' said O'Brien.
'Don't deceive yourself.
But there was no time to think of that.
Everything had exploded into yellow light.
Inconceivable, inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain!
The guard was laughing at his contortions.
One question at any rate was answered.
Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain.
Besides, his memories were not continuous.
I must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable.
It was easier to confess everything and implicate everybody.
Besides, in a sense it was all true.
There were also memories of another kind.
The eyes grew larger and more luminous.
A man in a white coat was reading the dials.
There was a tramp of heavy boots outside.
The door clanged open.
The waxed-faced officer marched in, followed by two guards.
'Room 101,' said the officer.
The man in the white coat did not turn round.
It was O'Brien who was directing everything.
For seven years I have watched over you.
Now the turning-point has come.
He did not remember any ending to his interrogation.
His body was held down at every essential point.
O'Brien was looking down at him gravely and rather sadly.
Your especial fear is that it will be your backbone.
O'Brien drew back the lever on 310 1984 the dial.
'That was forty,' said O'Brien.
Do you understand that?' 'Yes,' said Winston.
O'Brien's manner became less severe.
When he spoke his voice was gentle and patient.
You know perfectly well what is the matter with you.
You are mentally deranged.
You suffer from a defective memory.
Fortunately it is curable.
Now we will take an example.
He could not take his eyes away from the dial.
'The truth, please, Winston.
We were in alliance with them.
The war was against Eurasia.
That had lasted for four years.
'Another example,' he said.
'Some years ago you had a very serious delusion indeed.
It was THE photograph.
But he had seen it, unquestionably he had seen it!
For the moment he had even forgotten the dial.
'It exists!' he cried.
'No,' said O'Brien.
He stepped across the room.
There was a memory hole in the opposite wall.
O'Brien lifted the grating.
O'Brien turned away from the wall.
'Ashes,' he said.
'Not even identifiable ashes.
It does not exist.
It never existed.' 'But it did exist!
It does exist!
It exists in memory.
I remember it.
You remember it.' 'I do not remember it,' said O'Brien.
Winston's heart sank.
That was doublethink.
He had a feeling of deadly helplessness.
How could one be sure that it was simple trickery?
O'Brien was looking down at him speculatively.
His eyes flitted towards the dial.
O'Brien smiled faintly.
'You are no metaphysician, Winston,' he said.
I will put it more precisely.
Does the past exist concretely, in space?
It is written down.' 'In records.
And——?' 'In the mind.
In human memories.' 'In memory.
Very well, then.
'It is involuntary.
It is outside oneself.
How can you control memory?
You have not controlled mine!' O'Brien's manner grew stern again.
He laid his hand on the dial.
'On the contrary,' he said, 'YOU have not controlled it.
That is what has brought you here.
You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one.
Only the disciplined mind can see reality, Winston.
You also believe that the nature of reality is selfevident.
But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external.
Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else.
Whatever the Party holds to be the truth, is truth.
The needle of the dial had shot up to fifty-five.
The sweat had sprung out all over Winston's body.
O'Brien watched him, the four fingers still extended.
He drew back the lever.
This time the pain was only slightly eased.
'How many fingers, Winston?' 'Four!
What else can I say?
'How many fingers, Winston?' 316 1984 'Four!
Stop it, stop it!
How can you go on?
Four!' 'How many fingers, Winston?' 'Five!
Five!' 'No, Winston, that is no use.
You are lying.
You still think there are four.
How many fingers, please?' 'Four!
Anything you like.
He had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds.
The bonds that had held his body down were loosened.
'You are a slow learner, Winston,' said O'Brien gently.
'How can I help it?' he blubbered.
Two and two are four.' Sometimes, Winston.
Sometimes they are five.
Sometimes they are three.
Sometimes they are all of them at once.
You must try harder.
'Again,' said O'Brien.
The pain flowed into Winston's body.
The needle must be at seventy, seventy-five.
He had shut his eyes this time.
The pain lessened again.
He opened his eyes.
O'Brien had drawn back the lever.
'How many fingers, Winston?' 'Four.
I suppose there are four.
I would see five if I could.
Perhaps the needle was eighty—ninety.
Winston could not intermittently remember why the pain was happening.
The pain died down again.
He shut 318 1984 his eyes again.
I don't know.
You will kill me if you do that again.
A needle slid into Winston's arm.
The pain was already half-forgotten.
He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O'Brien.
O'Brien was a person who could be talked to.
It made no difference.
When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.
'Do you know where you are, Winston?' he said.
'I don't know.
I can guess.
Try again.' 'To punish them.' 'No!' exclaimed O'Brien.
Not merely to extract your confession, not to punish you.
Shall I tell you why we have brought you here?
To cure you!
To make you sane!
We do not merely destroy our enemies, we change them.
Again Winston's heart shrank.
At this moment, however, O'Brien turned away.
He took a pace or two up and down.
In the Middle Ages there was the Inquisitlon.
It was a failure.
Why was that?
There were the German Nazis and the Russian Communists.
Once again, why was it?
We do not make mistakes of that kind.
All the confessions that are uttered here are true.
We make them true.
Posterity will never hear of you.
thought Winston, with a momentary bitterness.
O'Brien smiled slightly.
'You are a flaw in the pattern, Winston.
You are a stain that must be wiped out.
We make him one of ourselves before we kill him.
The command of the old despotisms was 'Thou shalt not”.
The command of the totalitarians was 'Thou shalt”.
Our command is 'THOU ART”.
Everyone is washed clean.
I took part in their interrogation myself.
It was touching to see how they loved him.
The exaltation, the lunatic enthusiasm, was still in his face.
O'Brien was a being in all ways larger than himself.
His mind CONTAINED Winston's mind.
It must be he, Winston, who was mad.
O'Brien halted and looked down at him.
His voice had grown stern again.
No one who has once gone astray is ever spared.
What happens to you here is for ever.
Understand that in advance.
Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling.
Everything will be dead inside you.
You will be hollow.
There was pain coming, a new kind of pain.
O'Brien laid a hand reassuringly, almost kindly, on his.
'This time it will not hurt,' he said.
There was undoubtedly a blinding flash of light.
Winston was not hurt, only prostrated.
A terrific painless blow had flattened him out.
Also something had happened inside his head.
'It will not last,' said O'Brien.
'Look me in the eyes.
What country is Oceania at war with?' Winston thought.
'I don't remember.' 'Oceania is at war with Eastasia.
No such piece of paper ever existed.
You saw five fingers.
'There are five fingers there.
He saw five fingers, and there was no deformity.
O'Brien stood up with a satisfied air.
O'Brien turned to Winston with a smile.
You were right.
I enjoy talking to you.
Your mind appeals to me.
'It is switched off.
O'Brien smiled again.
'She betrayed you, Winston.
You would hardly recognize her if you saw her.
'Next question,' he said.
'Does Big Brother exist?' 'Of course he exists.
The Party exists.
Once again the sense of helplessness assailed him.
But what use was it to say so?
'I think I exist,' he said wearily.
'I am conscious of my own identity.
I was born and I shall die.
I have arms and legs.
I occupy a particular point in space.
No other solid object can occupy the same point simultaneously.
He exists.' 'Will Big Brother ever die?' 'Of course not.
How could he die?
His breast rose and fell a little faster.
There was a trace of amusement in O'Brien's face.
Even his spectacles seemed to wear an ironical gleam.
Evidently the session was at an end.
A needle jerked into Winston's arm.
He sank almost instantly into deep sleep.
'There is learning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance.
But of late his bonds were looser.
He could not remember how many sessions there had been.
'I wrote it.
That is to say, I collaborated in writing it.
The programme it sets forth is nonsense.
You foresaw yourself that that was what it would say.
It is all nonsense.
The rule of the Party is for ever.
'For ever!' he repeated.
Now tell me WHY we cling to power.
What is our motive?
Why should we want power?
Go on, speak,' he added as Winston remained silent.
Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or two.
A feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him.
He knew in advance what O'Brien would say.
You could see it in his face.
O'Brien knew everything.
A pang of pain had shot through his body.
'That was stupid, Winston, stupid!' he said.
It is this.
The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake.
What pure power means you will understand presently.
We are not like that.
Power is not a means, it is an end.
The object of persecution is persecution.
The object of torture is torture.
The object of power is power.
O'Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing the worn face nearer.
'We are the priests of power,' he said.
'God is power.
You know the Party slogan: 'Freedom is Slavery”.
Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible?
Slavery is freedom.
Alone—free—the human being is always defeated.
Over the body—but, above all, over the mind.
'But how can you control matter?' he burst out.
'We control matter because we control the mind.
Reality is inside the skull.
You will learn by degrees, Winston.
There is nothing that we could not do.
We make the laws of Nature.' 'But you do not!
You are not even masters of this planet.
What about Eurasia and Eastasia?
You have not conquered them yet.' 'Unimportant.
We shall conquer them when it suits us.
And if we did not, what difference would it make?
We can shut them out of existence.
And man is tiny—helpless!
How long has he been in existence?
For millions of years the earth was uninhabited.' 'Nonsense.
The earth is as old as we are, no older.
How could it be older?
Of course not.
Nineteenth-century biologists invented them.
Before man there was nothing.
Look at the stars!
Some of them are a million light-years away.
'They are bits of fire a few kilometres away.
We could reach them if we wanted to.
Or we could blot them out.
The earth is the centre of the universe.
This time he did not say anything.
But what of it?
Do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that?
Have you forgotten doublethink?' Winston shrank back upon the bed.
Had it not been exposed long ago as a fallacy?
But you are mistaken.
This is not solipsism.
Collective solipsism, if you like.
'By making him suffer,' he said.
By making him suffer.
Obedience is not enough.
Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation.
Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain.
Ours is founded upon hatred.
Everything else we shall destroy—everything.
The sex instinct will be eradicated.
We shall abolish the orgasm.
Our neurologists are at work upon it now.
There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party.
There will be no art, no literature, no science.
There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness.
All competing pleasures will be destroyed.
He could not say anything.
His heart seemed to be frozen.
O'Brien went on: 'And remember that it is for ever.
The face will always be there to be stamped upon.
Goldstein and his heresies will live for ever.
That is the world that we are preparing, Winston.
'You can't!' he said weakly.
It is a dream.
It would disintegrate.
It would commit suicide.' 'Nonsense.
Why should it be?
And if it were, what difference would that make?
Suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster.
Still what difference would it make?
If lost, please return to the De Laineys.
Sammy Lou takes pride in that record.
He should be used to being alone by now.
He can’t get caught.
He’s been breaking into houses for a year now.
He can’t get caught.
There’s always another way.
He slips around the house, undone shoelaces slapping his ankles.
He’s sore enough as is, thanks.
He’s a year off for his age.
Things this family is good at: locking their house.
Things they suck at: stacking wood into a sturdy pile.
The lock picks go flying into the darkness.
At least there’s not far to fall.
At least the woodpile doesn’t tip over too.
‘Dammit, Avery,’ Sam says.
I was joking.
Interruptions and complications and — Avery.
‘You’re OK?’ ‘What?’ Avery blinks, confused.
How shaky his hands suddenly are.
It’s just that rush of panic for nothing.
‘I’m about to be mad.’ Sam’s teeth clench.
Sam’s lost his night vision now.
He’s not caught.
‘That would fix everything.’ Of course it would, Avery.
His fingers curl into fists.
Sticky with blood.
It’s all bluff anyway, because he’d never hit Avery.
In fact, it’s the opposite.
Avery wilts, shoulders hunched to make himself a smaller target.
Sam is stupid, stupid.
He shouldn’t have said that.
‘Why didn’t you hear me coming?’ Avery says.
We.’ Sam opens his mouth to argue, but why bother?
Sam’s never said no to him in his life.
Plus he’s not wrong about how loud they’re being.
Sam’s truly lost it this evening.
Not that it’s an untrue feeling.
Not when he has blood on his knuckles.
He suddenly feels very tired.
It’s just this.
All of it.
And don’t – don’t break anything.
I want to stay here for a few days.
Sam smothers his annoyance.
He keeps them for emergencies.
His fingers shake.
‘Are you screwing up?’ Avery says in a conversational tone.
Sam stabs harder at the lock.
But a night alone would be a quiet break.
This is your brother.
You don’t need a break.
You shouldn’t want one.
‘I just missed you,’ Avery says.
‘Sure,’ Sam says, knowing Avery won’t notice the sarcasm.
They let him sleep on their broken sofa.
And that sameness?
Only having to rotate between two places that don’t change?
That’s why Sam’s bloody and bruised tonight, isn’t it?
Fixing things for Avery.
So, simple: he doesn’t get to know.
How much it scares him.
Avery chews his lip.
Now to wash off the blood.
Now to curl up in a soft chair.
Now to be still.
Except Avery is here and Avery is never still.
Sam flies across the room and slaps the switch off.
‘Close the blinds.
Avery really is ruining it.
Where he can breathe.
An invisible boy living in an empty house.
Avery is anything but invisible.
Avery pets it excitedly.
Sam says no way in hell.
When they’ll come back.
He finds a flight itinerary in the rubbish.
He could have a week in this house.
But just to be sure, he checks: pet food dishes?
Evidence of a house sitter?
Food in the fridge?
The house is his.
His shoulders relax a fraction.
He didn’t always rob the houses.
Eat the food.
Pretended he could keep this.
Then he started taking keys.
To remember each house by.
Then he started taking money.
Hidden credit cards.
Except tonight, apparently.
What did you do now, Avery?
Sam just fixed Avery’s last screw-up.
He’s not ready for another.
They’re his) but Avery appears from behind the pantry door.
‘What the hell,’ he says, ‘are seaweed crackers?’ Sam sighs.
‘These are diseased.
Anyway, I want to—’ He looks up.
‘Leave it.’ His voice stays low.
Avery doesn’t notice Sam’s tone, he hardly ever does.
His legs swing, pace growing frantic.
Those are the rules.’ Crackers crunch.
Heels drum on the bench.
‘I guess we both broke the rules,’ Sam says quietly.
Avery’s eyes widen.
‘But I—’ ‘Save it.
Avery snaps his fingers by his ears and doesn’t answer.
This is all so unfair.
He’d need him.
Avery would have a chance to redeem himself.
The guy was big, but Sam’s good at fighting.
It scares Avery, the way Sam hits.
It scares Sam too.
But what’s he supposed to do?
He’s got nothing else.
‘In a stolen car?
Are you insane?’ ‘We’d ditch it tomorrow.
I know cars.
‘Our plan sucks.’ Avery rocks on the bench.
Let’s just drive away.
Doesn’t he know Sam at all?
Sam looks down at his hands, fisted and trembling.
And you’re a wanted criminal.
We’re going to live in our own house.
We’re going to be OK.
‘No.’ But there are too many cracks in Sam’s voice.
How unrealistic his wishes are.
How naive he’s being.
Avery’s voice grows shrill.
‘But if we stay the police will catch you!
I can’t let them catch you.
It splinters against the tiles like a gunshot.
Someone’s going to hear.
This is Avery.
‘I’ll steal a car and drive away by myself.
You c-can get caught if you want.
I don’t care.
‘Don’t say that.’ Sam’s voice is barely a whisper.
‘I’ll leave you.’ Don’t ever, ever say that.
He slams the door on his way out.
Sam doesn’t understand.
But he can’t stay here now.
He should run after Avery.
He didn’t mean it, right?
They’re all each other has.
Avery’s the only who sees Sammy Lou, the forgotten boy.
I’ll leave you.
Sam doesn’t take anything on his way out.
That’s his secret failure.
He doesn’t break into houses because he enjoys stealing.
No, let’s have a winter rerun.
Won’t that be fun?
It keeps most of the rain off.
Avery will go back to his shifty friends’ house.
No, no he will.
It was a stupid threat.
He could never just go.
It’ll be a nice day – Saturday, right?
At least that’s what he pretends normal people do.
His thoughts spin, dizzying.
He feels genuinely ill right now.
His nose won’t stop running.
She might be in a good mood.
Or she’ll call the police.
Who is he kidding?
This is Aunt Karen.
If she sees him, she’ll go straight to the phone.
Stealing houses is an art.
He needs to get off the streets and lie down.
He tries two houses.
The second house is definitely a victim of longer-term abandonment.
He can’t risk staying here.
He could find a payphone and call Avery.
At least his clothes dry in the warm midday sun.
Wow, he’s so healthy.
Sam checks the street.
He listens at the doors but it’s silent.
Please be empty, please please please.
It’s an open-plan room, with support poles instead of walls.
Check for fresh food?
Still … that’s promising.
Another sign that the occupants are away.
Back on Sunday.
The house is his.
Take that, you freaking streaming nose.
Sam’s favourite type of house.
By the way, Sam, you are a freak.
He feels feverishly warm.
OK, so these people don’t believe in cupboards.
They believe in obstacle courses.
He has a new appreciation for only having one brother.
Imagine a dozen Averys?
No thank you.
He is so very, very tired.
Side effects probably … definitely … include … drowsiness.
The sun is so warm on his cheek.
But if Sammy complains he’ll just get another slap.
Avery hums softly to himself in the seat beside Sammy.
He knows Avery’s just sharing, but Sammy’s hungry.
Then he goes still.
Scared of a slap.
Scared, even more, that Avery will get it.
He should’ve stayed quiet.
People stream out and in, wearing silly dresses.
They must be cold.
He reaches back and snatches the toy off Avery.
Avery gives a surprised yelp.
A sick hole gnaws at Sam’s stomach.
‘Grow up, Avery,’ their dad snaps.
His voice is a warning growl.
‘I’ll be a few minutes.
Sit here while I pick something up.
Sammy glances sideways at Avery.
He needs his car.
It’s his special car.
He always has it.
Fix this, Sammy.
‘He’ll give it back,’ says Sammy.
‘Just be good.
Just wait.’ Please please please.
His dad has been angry ever since.
Well, he’s always angry.
This is not good.
He can’t move.
He hates loud things.
Why’s he going in there?
He doesn’t need his car that much, does he?
He sits there, handfuls of wild butterflies in his belly.
Avery never figures anything out.
But maybe it’ll be OK?
Are they all laughing?
You have to hold him.
You have to take him away till he calms down.
Even Sammy knows this and he’s only seven.
Hard to do because Avery writhes and kicks.
Sammy holds his breath.
It’ll fix everything.
It doesn’t matter if Avery’s too old.
It makes him feel better.
And he hits him.
Avery’s screams turn to sobs.
Sammy fights with his seatbelt now.
No one to hear over the thunder of the club.
Sammy’s beaten his knuckles bloody on the window.
Sammy can’t breathe.
He is red fire and he is burning.
You’re not allowed to hit Avery like that.
You’re not allowed.
He stretches shivering fingers to his brother.
His brother who is finally still and quiet.
He’s being good.
He wriggles free and crawls across the seat to Avery.
But his eyes find the rearview mirror and meet Sammy’s.
His dad’s eyes are furious.
Sammy hates him.
Sammy, strong and fierce, crouches over his brother.
‘It’s OK,’ Sammy whispers.
Sammy’s voice is trembly but fierce.
‘I’ll kill them.’ Deep in the house, Avery is shouting.
But he hasn’t slept this well in a long time.
Probably because he drugged himself.
Sam frowns in his sleep.
He’s in an empty house.
That’s not … empty.
He’s in a house that’s not empty.
He’s not even sure what time it is.
Did he sleep all night?
He scrabbles off the armchair and over to the desk.
Sam’s slept for a whole day.
This can’t be happening.
Not hearing Avery sneak up on him is one thing.
But sleeping through a family returning?
He’s losing his touch.
He’s losing his mind.
They haven’t come in here yet, so that’s good.
Nothing is good.
He’s in a house full of people.
He can’t get out.
‘DAD!’ a girl’s voice hollers right outside the office door.
‘Which one?’ someone else yells, softer and distant.
Hands scrabbling for a phone.
He has to hide.
Then the door opens and he forgets how to breathe.
A girl storms in.
Sam’s knees are at his throat.
His heart punches new bruises into his ribs.
You’re such an idiot, Sammy Lou.
Sam stuffs knuckles into his mouth and bites.
Just hold on, just wait.
And, pathetically, it’s special to him.
It’s the only thing he owns.
‘Ugh, Jack,’ she mutters, and steps over it.
She steps over it!
Sam remembers oxygen.
And in this mess, that’s probably likely.
Whoever ‘Jack’ is, he can happily take the blame.
Sam is fine with that.
Please don’t come back.
After a few deep gulps, he crawls out.
He grabs his backpack and opens the door a crack.
The hall is empty.
Unfortunately downstairs has no walls to hide behind.
When did he get so careless?
Don’t put it off.
He slips out of the warm office, his false safety.
He’s doing this.
The damage is immense.
There truly are half a million people down there.
A baby cries.
A plate breaks.
Someone yells for them to turn it down.
No, turn it off.
No, get ready for lunch.
Get the baby.
Wash your hands.
Stop eating all the corn chips.
Faces light up.
They are all hopelessly consumed with each other.
Drunk on people and noise and food.
Sam can do this.
Isn’t that his entire life?
Sam moves for the stairs, hand on the rail.
Blood pulses in his ears.
Do not look at her at all.
His eyebrows are angry forests.
‘Dude, I don’t even recognise you,’ he says.
Don’t you know how Sundays work?
The exit is officially an ocean away.
They could all see him if only they looked up.
They’re shooed along by another boy.
But the boy beats him to it.
But – oh wait.
He stole a shirt.
It’s probably unique.
It’s probably special.
He didn’t mean to be here.
‘Jeremy’s friend?’ The boy sighs.
Did he even tell you how Sundays work?
‘You look shell-shocked.
Hit him and run.
He nearly does.
Then he’s gone.
Sam might be having a panic attack.
Oh, you must be one of Jeremy’s friends, right?
And he’s nodding.
What is he supposed to do?
Just a little.
Well, what the hell, right?
He’s officially taken house burglary to the next level.
He’s stealing families and their Sunday lunches.
Faces blur together.
He’s totally fine with that.
But he won’t press his luck.
His pulse stutters.
Well, he knew he’d get caught, didn’t he?
He deserves the shriek of intruder.
Except it doesn’t come.
‘I was just leaving—’ Sam says.
‘Kitchen.’ She claps her hands together briskly.
Dishwasher is already full.
After all, he did eat their food.
This entire day is doing his head in.
Plates keep coming.
He wipes his sodden hands on his shirt.
He takes one.
‘Take two,’ says the man.
Did they leave you with the dishes?
They’re now playing cricket on the street.
‘I’ll leave the plate here.
He’s so pathetic, right?
That he’d lap this up.
The girl still looks at Sam.
‘So,’ says the girl.
She’s going to talk to him?
You’re kind of small compared to Jeremy’s usual strays.
‘I don’t trust you.’ Sam’s throat is dry.
‘Well, I don’t trust whoever killed this pot.
‘That was me.’ Oh.
He notices there’s handsewn embroidery all over the skirt.
So she’s the seamstress.
‘Well,’ Moxie says, ‘it sucked.
‘How was your trip?’ Moxie says.
‘The camping trip you boys all went on?
You all need to shower, by the way.
For hours.’ Sam can play along, right?
He’s got this.
‘Oh, well … it was great.
Good, um, weather.’ What do you even say about camping?
He’s never been camping.
‘Chatty, aren’t you?’ Moxie licks brownie off her thumb.
Why is he still talking?
‘Excuse you,’ Moxie says.
‘Speaking of being disagreeable,’ she says.
‘Why hasn’t Jeremy come to rescue you anyway?
Technically now I’m yours.
‘Hey, we’re going to the beach,’ a boy tells Moxie.
‘Hi,’ he says.
‘Are you Moxie’s friend?
She doesn’t usually invite people over.’ He smiles.
‘I’m Jeremy.’ No, I’m supposed to be your friend.
‘Ah, yeah, Moxie’s friend,’ Sam says.
Get out of there, man.
We’re going to the beach.
He’s not going to the beach with them.
Because why not.
Just don’t ask me who I am.
Jeremy reappears, eating leftover potato salad with a soup ladle.
‘Ready?’ he says to no one in particular.
Is Moxie back yet?
What’s she doing up there?’ He raises his voice.
‘How long does it take to put swimmers on, Moxie!
‘Girls,’ he says.
Jack yelps and grabs his side like he’s been shot.
The hordes pour towards the door.
And Moxie is nearly a head shorter than everyone else.
He wonders if she’s his age.
He wants this.
He absolutely can’t have it.
She catches his eye and he looks away.
‘Coming, dishwasher boy?’ It’s because they don’t know him.
He’s absolutely mad, of course, to follow them.
How could you?
They don’t know him.
Why the police want him.
Why his aunt won’t even look at him.
And it feels good.
She glances sideways at Sam.
‘Are you swimming in jeans?
She bats it off and glares.
‘Eh, just swim in your boxers,’ Jeremy says lightly.
He jerks the hem down quickly.
She purses her lips together, like she’ll ask.
Please don’t ask.
It’s deep enough.
We threw Jack in headfirst to test it once.
No broken neck.’ ‘Pity,’ mutters Moxie.
‘And definitely don’t do anything Jack wouldn’t do.
Actually, don’t do anything Jack would do.
Sam finds himself looking anywhere but at her indigo bikini.
And then realises how conspicuous that is.
And then realises he’s blushing.
And then decides he needs to go drown.
Moxie never so much walks as marches with angry intensity.
Jeremy pats Sam on the shoulder.
‘You look nervous.
The water seems deep.
The rocks are hot.
Jack ignores her, eyes lighting on Sam.
Sam’s heart still crawls into his mouth.
He looks away.
He can’t imagine Avery enjoying this day.
He tries, but he just can’t.
‘Hey!’ someone says, a note of panic in their voice.
Does it matter?
And the sea hits him.
It’s shockingly cool.
Then his head splits the surface.
Where was the part where he stayed low profile?
Something like anger.
Jeremy treads water and then splashes water into Sam’s face.
‘Maniac.’ But he’s smiling.
‘It’s not hard.’ ‘Oi!
‘Sam?’ But he says it like a question.
‘Well, get up here.
Jeremy dodges and gets a mouthful of ocean.
He goes under garbling.
‘Get up here, kid.
I’m keeping you.
Underwater, no one but the ocean sees him smile.
Sammy is seven and maybe Avery is dead.
They drove all night.
Please please please.
The car pulls into a driveway, the engine rattles off.
Sammy, now with Avery’s head in his lap, goes stiff.
Then he hammers the front door.
Karen, open up.’ A dog across the street barks.
A slow car rumbles past.
Avery shifts in his arms.
There’s something wrong with Avery’s eyes.
They’re dull and broken and hollow.
He drags Avery out.
Avery doesn’t even whimper.
‘Be on your best behaviour.’ His voice is raw.
Her lips are a line.
Her brow furrows.
‘What’s going on, Clay?’ she snaps.
‘I just told you, Jen isn’t here.
His aunt stares.
‘I haven’t seen you kids in four years.
No, six.’ ‘I’m Sammy,’ he whispers.
He doesn’t remember her.
Like, in his head, their dad hasn’t stopped hitting him.
Then his dad yells.
Then Aunt Karen yells.
Sammy wants to cover Avery’s ears.
His whole trembling body.
Someone has to protect him.
But he can do this.
Then he turns on his boys, eyes molten pools.
Sammy’s chest tightens.
But his dad just holds out the toy car.
Sammy’s chest tightens, a fist on his lungs.
Then he snatches the car.
‘Because that’s where it ends, Sammy boy.
He wouldn’t give them to his dad anyway.
Aunt Karen comes back inside, rewrapping her tulip dressing gown.
‘Is he coming back soon?’ Sam says.
Aunt Karen closes her eyes.
‘You’re staying with me for a while.
Aunt Karen sighs and reaches for Avery.
‘Avery,’ she snaps.
‘Let me help.
To stand on top of the wicker chair and scream.
His eyes are burned out blue.
‘Don’t take his—’ Sammy says, but it’s too late.
Avery starts screaming.
And he just doesn’t stop.
Sam hesitates on the stairs.
‘You might as well stay for dinner,’ she says.
‘Sunday night is waffles.’ Sam stays.
The house has emptied considerably.
Moxie’s dad waves from the kitchen.
Hopefully that’s a joke.
‘How many are staying, Jeremy?’ he says.
‘We’re teenage boys.’ Jeremy smacks him playfully on the head.
‘Only six of us guys left.
Thanks for remembering me.
Don’t forget Jack’s new adopted hatchling Sam.’ Sam shrinks.
He can’t help it.
‘Did you swim in your clothes?
Their father wisely makes more waffles.
‘Dude, don’t you ever eat?
Please consume at least nineteen waffles tonight.
‘He could wear a towel?’ Sam feels a little panicky.
Then she notices.
‘What?’ She looks at them and then at Sam.
No.’ ‘Come on, he’s your height,’ Jeremy says.
‘I’ll clean his clothes super fast.
He looks up to three concerned faces.
‘Look, he’s gone and caught cold,’ Jeremy says reproachfully.
‘I had the flu already,’ Sam says.
It’s nothing.’ The father turns back to the griddle.
‘Wet clothes aren’t helping.
Moxie …’ He casts her a meaningful look.
Moxie throws her hands in the air.
‘Oh, fine.’ She stabs a finger at him.
Or would he be?
He’s not exactly a stranger any more.
He showed Jack how to do a backflip.
Someone tipped sand down his shirt.
He’s eaten their potato salad and worn their clothes.
The trouble is he stole it all, every moment.
And that’s the part people don’t overlook.
They feel betrayed.
Betrayed people have the hardest fists.
This whole family is really forceful.
‘But these are girls’ jeans …’ Sam starts.
Moxie abruptly releases him and narrows her eyes.
‘If they don’t fit, then we’ll discuss,’ Moxie says.
‘But they’re big on me anyway.
Towels under the sink.
‘Jeremy,’ she clarifies.
‘Jeremy does laundry.
Jack does yard work.
Grady is supposed to houseclean, but he whinges about allergies.
I look after the babies way too much.
‘That bruise looked pretty vicious.
What happened?’ Lies run through Sam’s head.
None tumble out of his mouth.
‘Hmm,’ Moxie says.
He gets a real hot shower.
With real soap.
He feels like Moxie chose it on purpose.
The tone downstairs is as worn out as he feels.
Then she slides it back to him.
‘The De Lainey special.
The rest of the little kids were my Uncle Robin’s.
‘Six hellion cousins there.
Maybe she won’t think too hard about it?
‘No, Grady’s the oldest,’ Moxie says.
Jeremy and Jack are next.
‘I heard that,’ Dash says.
Moxie rolls her eyes.
So he’s left to slide a tentative question at her.
Not that he has any right to ask.
Not that he should be drawing attention to himself.
‘And you?’ Moxie says.
Grady uses a spoon as a bookmark and looks up.
Sam should leave before Moxie asks more questions.
Sam feels sick around adults.
But there are still waffles left and … well, waffles.
‘Wishful,’ their father says, ‘but no.
Absolutely not, Dad.’ ‘I’ll take the weekends,’ their father says.
Except that he is.
Her father’s voice stays unfailingly mild.
‘Sweetie, I’m not trying to make it that way.
Mr De Lainey builds houses?
His heart beats a little faster.
‘Right, so we’re sorted?’ Jack says.
Gotcha.’ Their father’s lips thin.
And we talked about this.
And there are …’ His voice thickens.
Grady immediately gathers plates and mumbles something about loving building.
‘You can knock off at three,’ his dad says.
‘Moxie.’ Their father gently nudges her shoulder.
‘Murmph.’ ‘Look, it’s just the babies.
‘We’re going to make a film!
‘And I was going to work on my design portfolio.
I’m alone and broken.’ Her father starts clearing up plates.
‘You can still sew.
I’ll take over as soon as I get home.
And when school starts, we’ll get the babies in daycare.
This deadline is a beast.’ ‘Fine.
‘I’m sure your folks aren’t spoiling your summer plans, eh?
The lights flick off.
Moxie flops on the sofa next to Sam.
It was the only available seat, he tells himself.
That’s why she sat next to him.
All at once.
Even though the movie seriously freaks him out.
There’s plenty of air.
But his lungs don’t quite work any more.
Stop twitching your fingers.
Like they’re seeing him, really seeing him.
Sam opens his mouth – to defend himself?
‘Did you see his face?
‘How is his hearing so good?’ Jeremy pats his shoulder.
‘Only for you and your swearing, buddy.
His face is so hot, his clothes so tight.
Sam wants to bury himself.
‘You nearly pissed yourself,’ Jack says.
Jeremy hits him.
Moxie is still laughing silently, a hand over her mouth.
‘I’m sorry.’ Her voice is soft as sand and sea.
‘I shouldn’t have laughed.
Pathetic, pathetic Sam.
‘There’s still part two,’ Jack says.
Sam might be sick.
‘It’s past eleven.’ Moxie licks popcorn salt off her thumb.
This is the part where Sam slips away.
He’ll never have this again.
He has to leave.
Friends that Sam’s supposed to be leaving with.
Sam looks at the stairs.
He wouldn’t dare.
His eyes rest on Sam.
‘Thanks for coming, Sam,’ says Mr De Lainey.
He remembers Sam’s name?
‘See you again soon, son.
You wouldn’t dare— Sam’s throat is tight.
He reaches for the kettle and a mug.
Sam bolts for the stairs.
No one will notice if he doesn’t come back downstairs.
No one will go into that office this late.
He’ll leave tomorrow.
One last night that feels strangely like … home.
Sammy is eight and it’s war at the kitchen table.
He gets overwhelmed and cries.
He gets that way about a lot of things.
He’s getting too much for Aunt Karen to pin down.
That’s why she’s on the phone.
‘—complete rubbish, Clay.
The phone call, however, he understands just fine.
I do not want these goddamn boys.
A forever scar.
Their aunt gives a frustrated shout and then goes silent.
She strides into the kitchen, all hard edges and splinters.
His ear still smarts from being caught and slapped too.
Sammy’s legs freeze, mid-swing, shoelaces making a final clack.
Like Avery is trying to be difficult.
Frantic fluttering crawls up Sammy’s throat.
That can’t happen.
He’s Avery’s protector, his everything.
He’s not listening.
Sammy’s words come choked.
‘But, please, you c-can’t.
‘Fine.’ She stomps to the kitchen.
He loves those.
It hurts him.
Sammy could tell her this if she listened.
If anyone listened.
But he is the invisible boy and no one cares.
Avery’s eyes widen.
Aunt Karen spins on Sammy.
‘Stay out there like animals then!’ The door slams.
The lock clicks.
They’re used to this, but it’s cold tonight.
Avery’s hands flutter.
‘I c-c-can’t—’ ‘I know.’ Sammy pets his arm.
‘Just let me think.
‘I could steal some tools.’ Excitement flickers in his voice.
‘I could steal some biscuits too.
His eyes are just sad.
‘Can you do that?’ Avery whispers.
‘Steal houses?’ ‘Yeah,’ Sammy says.
It sounds very traumatic.
The two little kids are tag-team crying.
Jack and Moxie lock in a shouting match.
No one can find car keys.
Dash says she’s leaving home.
Goodbyes are hollered.
The front door slams.
Engines fade down the road.
He picks up.
Puts it back.
He’s obviously saving this for worst-case scenarios.
But Sam is a thief.
This is what he does, isn’t it?
He pokes his head out the door.
The house is suddenly quiet.
Sam slips across the hall and peeks through the stairwell.
A De Laineyflavoured explosion has hit.
‘Quit it, Toby,’ she orders.
‘You’re having a bath.
Water turns on.
Toby howls like he’s being murdered.
The baby toddles after them, cradling a pot of jam.
Sam’s getaway path is clear.
Except he doesn’t want to get away.
But he can’t stay.
And also because Avery might be gone.
Where else can Sam go?
He looks like trouble.
The De Lainey cash just slips through his fingers.
This is his life.
Steal and spend and stay alive.
Sam usually comes in the back, but not today.
Which is why, distracted, he walks straight into the boss.
‘Sammy Lou.’ He has a voice like old engines.
He’s still here.
‘Sorry,’ Sam says.
‘You know what’s breaking around here?
My mind on why I kept that kid on.
He’s practised this look for maximum patheticness.
‘I’m really sorry for distracting him.
‘Just don’t distract him.
So Avery got his second chance.
His bare arms are stick thin and smeared with grease.
Is that about their fight?
‘You stayed,’ Sam says.
‘What?’ Avery pauses, arms half lost in the engine.
‘What are you talking about?’ ‘The other night?
Avery’s eyes narrow.
‘That was just talk.
Does my boss know you’re here?
So Avery knows what Sam did.
Oh, he definitely knows.
And this is all Avery’s fault anyway, right?
You need this job.’ ‘That was an accident.
Sam bites back his pained whimper.
Avery’s voice rises.
‘You meant to break someone’s hand.
I hate it.
Agonising heat flushes Sam’s cheeks.
He wants to shove him back, but he can’t.
He’d never touch Avery to hurt him.
‘You need this job.’ Sam’s voice is low.
But his breathing evens out.
Shut up about it.’ Avery’s teeth clench.
‘I mean it.
It drives Sam mad, because Avery is good with engines.
But he has to stay calm.
Not get overwhelmed.
Not let anyone see him freak out.
The police must not find the Lou brothers.
After what Sam did at school last year?
Sam wants to shout: Look, Avery!
This is exactly why you can’t be alone!
Who’d calm you down if I wasn’t here?
This is what brothers do.
He fiddles with a loose thread on his jeans.
He can’t believe he forgot to change.
He’ll add it to their savings.
‘Can we not fight?’ Sam whispers.
‘S-stop hurting people.
‘Then stop screwing up,’ Sam says.
No one looks twice.
They’re here to work.
He clearly doesn’t trust Avery alone in the workshop.
Which ends up with the Lou brothers analysing tourist targets.
Someone happy or affectionate.
Someone who’ll care.
Avery gives him a sour look.
He could use a bath.
Sam still has on the smiley-face shirt and Moxie’s jeans.
Does she wonder about him?
Why’s he even thinking that?
Sam rubs the back of his sweaty neck.
‘Well, we can’t do the one where you fake-vomit.
‘I’m hitting, you’re running.’ Sam gives him a flat look.
Obviously that’s how they divide the parts.
He can’t even fake hitting Avery.
‘Stop calling them “jobs”.
What do think this is?
Like it’s sliding.
He wants to catch it before someone falls.
He puts it in the bin.
Avery stands, anticipation in his jittering arms.
Their handbag isn’t quite zipped.
Sam’s hand is in and out before he stands up.
Right on the bruise.
Sam’s wince is real.
‘You want to run that by me again?’ Avery shouts.
Sam slaps his hand away.
‘Hey, take it easy.’ He’s not faking, though.
Avery’s a little too into it today.
‘Shut the hell up!’ Avery shoves him again.
His neck snaps to the side.
His teeth sink into his tongue.
His vision fractures.
Avery really really forgot to fake that punch.
Blood dribbles down his chin.
Someone gives a heartfelt gasp.
People back off and stare.
Voices flood over Sam.
‘I’m fine.’ The words slur without trying.
His hand darts toward a back pocket.
Someone gives a grateful cry.
‘Here comes a security guard!’ Sam’s body tenses.
They need to run now.
But she’s paused, wipes halfway to the baby’s face.
Moxie stares at him.
Sam jerks away.
Did she see his face?
She wouldn’t have.
It’s Sam’s fault.
He let himself get distracted.
They should be gone by now.
Sam doesn’t think.
Hey!’ The person lunges at him.
Sam tips two fingers in salute and then— runs.
Then he’s gone.
He never looks back to see if Sam made it.
Sam takes care of himself.
The security guard chases, shouting into his walkie-talkie.
Noise runs over his back.
Bodies shove him out the way.
He’s lost in a crowd.
The last wallet is still in his hand.
Not a bad haul.
He walks and flips through them.
The second is a fat tourist wallet.
Fifties and twenties.
Then he drops that wallet in a flowerbed.
If he can find Avery.
His fingers press gently at his jaw.
It’s not like that’s usual for him, right?
But this is Avery.
He hates hitting.
It doesn’t matter.
She’s nobody to him.
But he keeps looking.
And he sees her again.
Moxie De Lainey.
Sam wonders if she’s talking about him.
Yeah sure, Sam.
The entire world revolves around you.
She probably (definitely) didn’t recognise you.
She probably (definitely) didn’t care.
STOP.’ Sam’s fingers freeze.
His head snaps up.
Sam doesn’t even think.
Cars stream forward.
Sam’s shoes hit the road.
He twists so his back is to the oncoming car.
‘Moxie,’ Sam says.
Just a whisper.
Just a breath.
It’s all happened so fast.
No chance to think.
A horn blasts.
Undone shoelaces twist around Sam’s ankles.
He takes a breath.
The car hits.
Then the world stammers to an abrupt halt.
It doesn’t hurt.
He doesn’t care.
Car doors slam.
Voices rise in panicked flurry.
Blood, hot and thick and metallic, coats Sam’s arms.
He pushes himself up.
Let me call an ambulance—’ The driver is sobbing.
Someone has a phone out, frantically dialling.
‘No.’ Sam tastes hot bitumen, salty blood.
He scrambles to his feet.
He looks for Moxie.
Their backs are to Sam.
Their father’s shoulders shake.
But there’s not a scratch on the little boy.
Sam clutches at the car hood for a second.
‘I’m fine.’ Moxie looks up over her father’s shoulder.
Sam turns away.
He’s fine, he’s fine fine fine.
His body screams so he just runs faster.
Blood slicks down his arms.
Just get away.
Don’t let people see.
Don’t let them notice.
The footpath ends here.
He sinks into the gutter, grabbing his stomach.
The ground pulses and agony flashes in his guts.
He puts his head between his legs and vomits.
Tears spill next, hot and fat down his cheeks.
A shadow falls over his head.
‘Whoa,’ Avery says.
‘Sammy.’ His voice is high and panicked.
‘What the hell, Sammy?
You could’ve died!
Why would you even – you idiot.
You cc-could’ve died!
Sam hurts he hurts he hurts.
‘I don’t need a hospital.
Shut up, OK?
You’re lying.’ Sam glances sideways at him.
Avery’s hands spin as he crouches by Sam.
‘Avery,’ he whispers, ‘it was a little kid.
So just shut up.’ Avery grabs Sam’s shoulder.
We’ll go to my friend’s place.’ Oh, great.
‘No,’ Sam says, voice rough.
‘I don’t like them.’ ‘What?
‘She’ll call the police on us.
‘You don’t understand a single freaking thing.
His eyes go blank, guttered out.
When their dad hit him.
Avery just shuts down.
Sam has never made him do that before.
Avery rises and skitters back.
And he runs.
Anger suddenly whitens behind Sam’s eyes.
Sam shoves to his feet and limps down the street.
People stare, but he focuses ahead.
He looks over his shoulder.
Avery hasn’t come back.
Because it hurts.
That’s the only reason.
No one notices Sam.
Obviously he should go steal another house.
But he’s not staked anything out.
It could take for ever to find one.
And he hurts.
He hurts too much to pick a lock.
He hurts too much to rob a family.
He hurts too much to breathe.
That’s not an option.
He doesn’t even know them.
They don’t know him.
They wouldn’t want to know him.
Sam can’t just sneak back in.
If you count how he hits things.
He wonders if Moxie is back.
If she recognised him.
If Toby is really all right.
He can’t just go in.
Unless … Unless he says he’s Moxie’s friend.
Depends on who’s asking.
He has to come up with a story.
He … fell?
Good one, Sam.
No one will see through that.
You want to con someone?
Like they’re expecting him.
It hurts to stand straight, but he’ll do it.
The front door is already open.
He raps knuckles on the doorframe.
A hand shoots up from the sofa and waves vaguely.
‘Come in,’ says a tired voice.
‘Unless you’re an axe murderer.
Then stay out or whatever.’ ‘Wow, Jeremy.
That was convincing.
Sam steps in, muscles coiled.
‘It’s Sam.’ Jeremy’s head pops up from behind the sofa.
A soft grin spreads across his face.
Here for Moxie?’ Sam comes in a little further.
He’s committed now, isn’t he?
‘Oh, right.’ Jeremy flops back down.
He can’t see Sam at all now.
‘Moxie is out,’ Jack says.
‘Dad’s bribing her with gelato.
Favouritism.’ ‘They’ll be back soon, though,’ Jeremy adds.
Sam realises they don’t know what happened to Toby.
It’s been an hour, maybe two, and Moxie hasn’t returned.
Maybe Toby is actually hurt?
He slips towards the staircase.
His heart rabbits so fast he can scarcely think.
What the hell is he doing?
He can’t just … he can’t be doing this.
But he is.
Buckets of bath toys block the way to the sink.
He presses that to his side and nearly passes out.
When is he going to grow some freaking brains?
Like the glorious idiot he is.
The vacuum shuts off.
‘Jack!’ Grady shouts.
Clean it up.
Now.’ Jeremy’s voice drifts from downstairs, sweet and innocent.
‘Don’t be insensitive, bro.
‘I am so sick of both of you,’ Grady hollers.
Please go downstairs.
He clicks the office door shut.
And he’s alone.
It’ll end badly.
If someone bursts in here, what would he do?
Sink to his knees and cry.
The noise downstairs suddenly escalates and Sam’s shoulders tighten.
A baby shrieks.
Toby really is fine.
‘—hit by a car,’ Moxie is saying.
Voices mix and tumble.
Hit Jeremy with it.’ ‘—no, the baby’s fine.
He cracks open the office door to hear better.
And then he’ll have to run again.
Sammy is ten and he lost Avery.
This isn’t happening.
This can’t happen.
Avery isn’t waiting.
Avery is supposed to wait.
Sammy rips apart the school grounds looking.
nothing nothing nothing Don’t panic.
Maybe he walked home alone?
Sammy’s not even sure he could without getting lost.
Sammy runs the whole way, tattered backpack punching his spine.
He dumps it by their letterbox and runs inside.
‘Where’s Avery?’ he gasps.
Aunt Karen flicks her cigarette in the sink.
‘What are you talking about?
‘I don’t know where he is!
We have to go look.
‘He’s just avoiding chores, Sammy, and your dramatics are tiring.
Aunt Karen’s lips thin.
‘That’s enough attitude, young man.
He’s not a baby.
He’ll show up when he wants to.’ She doesn’t understand.
Sammy doesn’t wait.
He goes to the park, full of prickles and rubbish.
He flies across footpaths.
To the shops.
Back to school.
Back to the streets.
The air chills and smells of car exhaust and loneliness.
He runs anyway.
Sammy trails, dejected and exhausted, back to his street.
Avery could be dead.
It’s all Sammy’s fault.
His heartbeat stutters and fear pricks his skin.
There’s a glimpse of whiteblond hair.
He has energy after all.
‘I’m sorry,’ Sammy says.
‘I’m sorry, he’s s-sorry, we’re so so sorry.
He didn’t mean it.
He’s running his toy car up and down his face.
‘Hey, whoa there, little mate.
This is your brother?’ ‘I’m Sammy Lou,’ he says.
He has a split lip, but he smiles anyway.
‘We’re bringing your brother home.
Not taking him away.’ Sammy thinks he might cry.
He will not cry.
There are folded arms and frowns.
‘Come on, little mate,’ says the cop.
Digging in like a bite.
Like a barnacle.
The cop staggers in surprise, and then laughs.
Sammy hops after them, teeth chattering.
They must’ve been so, so nice to him.
Aunt Karen’s face is stony as they arrive.
The cop’s cut lip.
You can’t hit a cop.
He didn’t mean to.’ The woman gives a small smile.
‘Ah, you must be Sammy.
Avery needed him and he wasn’t there.
‘Please,’ Sammy whispers.
‘He wasn’t gone for that long.’ ‘Five hours,’ Sammy says.
His aunt shoots him a poisoned look.
The lady cop folds her arms.
And Aunt Karen has to listen.
‘Come on, kiddo, home now.
Safe and sound.’ Finally Avery lets go.
Too old for cars.
Too old to be carried.
Too old not to know his way home.
Sammy nearly smiles.
‘I’m lost,’ Avery whispers.
‘Not any more.’ Sammy casts damp eyes to the cop.
He tucks his hands behind his back.
‘No.’ The cop raises an eyebrow.
‘All right, Sammy, let’s talk seriously for a moment.
The cop nods, the lightness gone from his smile.
A lot of trouble.
You sort yourself out, hey?
It’s a lie, the nod.
The cop wouldn’t understand.
If kids hurt Avery, then what else can Sammy do?
He has to hit them.
He had to.
But he’s not like his dad.
He’d never never go too far.
The police leave.
Aunt Karen locks the door and marches into the kitchen.
‘I’ve had enough of this, Avery.
You know better.
Sammy shoves between them, all fire flares and burning blood.
Sammy matches Aunt Karen’s eyes, flint for charcoal.
Her teeth clench.
‘If you think he’ll learn from it, you’re wrong.
Sammy seals his lips tight.
He looks at Avery.
But Avery doesn’t scream for Aunt Karen to stop.
He just looks confused and scared.
No one saves Sammy.
It’s OK, right?
He’s used to it.
So long as his brother is safe.
He licks his thumb and flips the page.
He’s not been in here the entire three days, obviously.
Then he cased out a few houses.
He just hasn’t … moved … into … them yet.
Leftovers, for instance.
Jeremy’s Greek zucchini and halloumi falafel is incredible.
Moxie’s reheated spring rolls are disgusting.
The only worry that gnaws at his chest is Avery.
Always, always Avery.
He hasn’t seen him in three days.
But he’ll be with his friends.
Sam licks his thumb and flips another page.
He feels so guilty.
To bathe in?
‘TRY ME.’ A small smile tugs at Sam’s lips.
Dust lines the bookshelves.
He wonders what happened to the De Laineys’ mother.
Did she walk out too?
Sam can’t remember his mother’s face.
Leaving them with him.
Their dad and his fists and his molasses eyes.
She’s just another reason to never, never trust adults.
Sam drops the book.
But he doesn’t have time.
‘… because it’s illegal for kids to use glitter, actually.
‘I am twenty-five!’ Toby shouts.
‘Nice try,’ Moxie says and turns.
Don’t call the police yet.
I can explain.
Except he really really can’t.
Their eyes meet.
Air escapes Sam’s lungs like they’ve been punctured.
Toby stands behind her wearing a Batman mask.
‘Who’s dat?’ Moxie screams.
She hurls the ice cream tub at Sam.
The lid pops.
The air fills with a soaring, shimmering rainbow arc.
Moxie keeps screaming.
Toby joins in.
He jumps the veranda steps and his shoes hit cement.
Get out of here and don’t ever look back.
Asking himself why why why did he do this?
He didn’t want it to end like this.
It rakes his throat.
Get away from here.
He listens for sirens.
For someone to shout stop that thief.
Walk, Sammy, just keep walking.
Anywhere but here.
He doesn’t want to be here.
There are simple rules for surviving a lifestyle like his.
Number one: don’t get caught.
And he freaking blew that.
It makes him angry, all over again.
Aunt Karen’s street wasn’t much better.
And Avery’s just trotted right back in.
Because it’s familiar.
Because it’s home.
Yeah OK, the Lou brothers are still criminals.
Endless plans as they walked to and from school.
All they need is money, right?
It’s not impossible.
He stops outside a row of apartments.
Windows are barred.
Piles of junk sit in gutters.
Is this even the right number?
Does he know anyone who doesn’t want him in jail?
He needs new friends.
Or any friends.
A non-judgemental dog maybe.
‘What is my life?’ he mutters and knocks.
‘Is Avery Lou there?
I’m his brother.’ Silence.
Sam kicks the door.
‘Wow, it is you,’ Avery says.
‘I thought you hated this place.’ He pauses.
‘And me.’ Sam grits his teeth.
‘You know that’s not true.
Now can I come in?
I’m about to be arrested.’ Avery opens the door.
‘I guess that’s usual.
But I—’ He breaks off with a choke.
Sam shoves past, leaving glittering footprints.
Honestly, it wouldn’t be that hard to catch him.
Avery opens his mouth.
‘Just lend me some clothes and—’ Avery bursts out laughing.
‘It’s too much.
Avery makes a show of holding his breath.
Sam is done.
He’s just done.
And his brother is a jerk.
‘Screw you, Avery,’ Sam says.
He looks so much younger when he’s laughing.
Sam hopes he hacks up a lung.
The carpet smells like cat piss.
Sam rubs the bridge of his nose.
That’s a mistake.
A creep hiding in her house.
Hot, anxious knives carve his stomach.
‘So what happened?
‘Hilarious,’ Sam says.
Crumbs fall out of the folds.
Day off.’ But he has too many lying tells.
Like how he immediately hunches over, waiting for a blow.
‘Shower’s upstairs,’ he says, fast.
Sam sighs and follows him upstairs.
There are other closed doors, muted voices behind them.
‘Um, I don’t know?
‘Because I have friends.
What exactly is he saying?
‘But they’re all way older than you.’ They’re using you.
They’re bad news.
Are you a getaway driver?
Sammy does not have the energy for that conversation.
About what?’ Avery’s face is so open – so naive.
Sam scratches glitter behind his ear.
Just do it later.
‘About why you’re covered in glitter?’ Avery says.
‘Never mind,’ says Sam.
‘It won’t happen again.’ It will never, never happen again.
Just not glitter.
He gives up.
Why couldn’t Moxie have just slapped him?
He needed that fragile paradise.
He needed it so he could breathe again.
He hesitates over his glitter-covered clothes – De Lainey clothes.
Then he stuffs them into a garbage bag.
Forget it, Sam.
And he’s not alone.
They’re both drinking beer.
The girl looks him up and down coolly.
Once upon a time, it was little cars.
Sam tucks his hands into his jean pockets.
‘Um, hi … Vin.
‘Oh,’ Avery says, ‘you still look like roadkill.
Sam jerks his shirt back down.
That’s not why— Is it?
‘Avery,’ Sam tries again, voice quiet, ‘can we go?
Let’s—’ ‘I’ll take him over,’ Vin says.
It freaks him out, what happens when he’s not here.
Sam didn’t imagine it’d go this far.
‘Be nice,’ Avery whispers.
Sam is nice.
He’s obviously fixing it up for Vin.
Is that why she likes him?
The place is open.
An unfamiliar man talks with a customer over a car.
Sam’s chest aches.
Sam is nice instead of punching Vin in the throat.
He knows he’s being unreasonable.
The girl is just being decent.
No one seems angry.
She might think the backpack is full of coins, right?
Sam’s a thief.
Coins are logical.
Sam scrambles for his seatbelt.
She circuits them and pauses by the water edge.
‘Hey!’ Sam’s voice echoes, too shrill.
He springs forward.
The cry that escapes Sam’s lips is hardly human.
I’m letting you go now.
His cheeks are wet.
His backpack is gone.
‘He told me about your crazy habit.’ He told.
He doesn’t even understand when he shouldn’t.
But how long has he known about the keys?
I need a kid like you.
A good lock pick.
‘But you need to shed the baby face.
I mean look at you, kid.
You’re crying over a backpack.
He couldn’t even explain it to Avery.
The keys were promises.
They were all he had.
He doesn’t struggle.
But his arms hang loose at his sides.
Avery knew Vin was going to do this.
Drugs?’ Vin gives a laugh and slides on aviator sunglasses.
‘I know you’re only a kid, so come on.
I’ll buy you some chips on the way back.
Except he doesn’t want to die.
We gut houses like you do.
They have no idea.
It’s not about the stealing from houses.
It’s about stealing the houses.
Right now, his lungs are rust.
He follows Vin.
Avery drops down on the sofa where Sam’s sprawled.
Avery pokes the back of his neck.
Sam doesn’t react.
‘I looked at them when you slept.
All the time.
‘But Vin says—’ Sam flips channels faster.
‘Still glittery.’ ‘Surprise,’ Sam says, flat.
Isn’t it painfully obvious?
Avery chews his thumbnail, eyes on the TV.
‘I can take care of myself.’ That’s a hilarious joke.
‘You didn’t tell me how you got caught,’ Avery says.
Avery looks worried and Sam’s story trails off.
It doesn’t matter anyway.
There are things with sharper edges to unpack.
Sam’s still isn’t sure how old she is.
And it always seems like a rehearsed act.
She dumps the greasy paper bag on the coffee table.
Then she kisses Avery on the mouth.
She kisses a lot of different people, Sam’s noticed.
But talking about kissing and sex is too awkward, OK?
It shouldn’t be Sam’s job.
He’s only fifteen.
Except it always is his job.
She flops in a sofa and unwraps hers.
Vin hasn’t figured it out?
Or is this another thing she’s fixing?
Eat your food mixed.
Sam entirely hates Vin.
Why is Avery putting up with it though?
Because he likes her?
Sam feels sick.
Vin licks juice off her thumb.
‘How old are you anyway, Sammy?
Fourteen?’ Sam frowns.
He doesn’t want to do stuff like that.
Vin’s eyes narrow.
She gets her teeth whitened to prove it.
A muscle twitches in Sam’s jaw.
All of it.
Sam springs towards it, tripping over boxes of stacked junk.
Avery’s up hard against the wall.
Her eyes are bottomless and frigid.
‘—don’t disagree with me,’ Vin is saying.
That kid can fit.’ ‘I said n-no.’ Avery’s voice shakes.
His voice takes on a desperate edge.
He springs into the kitchen and shoves Vin off.
Cutlery slips and clatters to the floor.
Blood sprays hot over Sam’s fingers.
Avery gives a startled yell and grabs Sam’s waist.
‘Sammy, don’t—’ But fire blazes in Sam’s lungs.
Every time he explodes.
Blood soaks her shirt.
‘Don’t don’t.’ His voice cracks.
‘D-don’t hit people.
He can’t feel anything.
He’s spun out of invincible clouds.
Vin raises bloody fingers towards the door.
‘Get out.’ Sam’s anger is cooling, leaving his hands shaking.
‘Fine.’ His voice feels far away.
Tries to grab his wrist.
Avery jerks back.
Vin’s voice explodes.
A door slams upstairs.
How could he scare his brother?
He trips on the threshold.
Then she hurls him out and slams the door.
He waits an hour.
The lock comes apart under Sam’s thin, light fingers.
Except right now, Avery doesn’t want to be around him.
Sam scared his brother.
He scared his brother.
He has to stop doing this, losing it.
There’s nothing to take except handfuls of cobwebs.
Close your eyes and pretend this is a bed.
Pretend you don’t smell stale air and mouse bait.
Was she ever happy with them?
He puts in the De Lainey father.
And then a handful of De Lainey kids.
Her eyes meet his, chocolate curls spilling across her cheeks.
His words come cracked as a broken plate.
The bush waves encouragingly at him.
Sam clears his throat.
‘This is an apology present.
I didn’t steal it.
‘I’m sorry?’ The bush does not accept his apology.
But he has to try.
He doesn’t have anything to lose.
He doesn’t have anything.
His shoulders ache for his backpack.
You’re not allowed to think about Vin.
Or how you scared Avery so much he stayed.
They need their own home.
This can’t go well.
He’s so screwed.
He didn’t take a single key.
He feels sick whenever he sees them now.
Get up, you spineless coward.
His fingers curl to knock and then hesitate.
His heart stutters.
Sam awkwardly holds out the thread.
It’s so tiny.
He’s such an idiot.
Confusion fades from her face and fury washes down.
‘I’m sorry,’ Sam says.
Moxie slams the door in his face.
Well, that’s fair.
He deserves that.
Boys covered in concrete dust vault out.
‘Hey, is that Sammy?’ He can’t do this.
He doesn’t want to be hit.
‘Sam, wait!’ One of the twins strides around the rosebushes.
Sam’s stupid to come back.
That his fists weren’t raised.
That maybe he wanted to talk, not to hit.
He can’t go back to Avery.
Or the De Laineys’.
He’s so, so tired.
It’s nearly five.
She knocks off from the petrol station around now.
She used to.
He hasn’t been back in over a year.
Her fingers close around shopping bags before she sees him.
Like maybe he can make himself look younger, innocent, sorry.
What should he say?
He forces his feet forward.
Tuna, it looks like, powdered milk and rye crackers.
‘Are the police chasing you?’ Well, obviously.
‘Where’s Avery?’ Aunt Karen says.
She lets him.
‘He’s OK.’ No, he’s not.
‘He, um, works a real job.
With a mechanic.’ A lie now.
‘Just you.’ Sam looks down.
His shoelaces are undone.
‘Nothing.’ Sam’s mouth is full of cotton.
‘I’m not taking you back,’ Aunt Karen says.
‘You go inside my house and I’m calling the police.
I can see your hands, Sammy.
Still hitting people?
Do you know what you deserve?
To be locked up.
No second chances.
She won’t budge for that either.
‘Sorry is not enough,’ Aunt Karen says, vicious.
‘But can I just have one night?
Sam looks desperately at her back, needing her to understand.
Truly stop and see him.
He runs after her, heart falling through his chest.
Her hand shoots up and cracks across his face.
It takes a moment for the sting to catch up.
Sam stares, his mouth open, red fingerprints across his cheekbone.
‘I was protecting him,’ Sam whispers.
‘You like the power you get from hurting people.
You’re just like your father.’ Sam can’t speak.
That’s not him.
That’s never him.
Trying to keep himself here.
‘Don’t talk about Avery like that,’ he whispers.
It’s like she doesn’t hear him.
Aunt Karen says, voice suddenly crisp.
‘Are you coming inside?
You can sit down while I call you in.
You know you deserve it, Sammy Lou.’ A cute name.
Just Sammy Lou.
Does he deserve it?
you do you do you do you do He turns.
He walks away.
‘I thought so,’ Aunt Karen calls.
Her shoulders stay stiff.
Her face sets.
Or broken bones.
He’s having a rough life.
High school sucks.
He’s aware of how different he is now.
It’s stupid, wanting friends.
But Sammy understands.
He wouldn’t mind a friend.
Sammy’s worried school will kill Avery.
But he can fix this, right?
He fixes everything.
He scales it like Spiderman.
Hand over hand, propelled by momentum and sheer will.
But he’s up.
A happy shout.
Avery pulls his hood off.
‘I’ll catch the moon and steal it.
Are you coming?’ Avery is coming.
Note to self: stop babying him already.
But it’s fine.
He’s just happy.
Sammy can breathe again.
And it’s good.
Everything is good.
He jumps again and again.
And he can take what he wants.
‘Get down right now.
Sammy!’ Get down and get your ears slapped, she means.
Sammy nudges Avery with his elbow.
‘Together?’ ‘You,’ Avery whispers, ‘and me.
Aunt Karen hollers at them.
They smack together as they tumble through the split.
They tangle for a second in the uncut lawn.
The trampoline waves torn threads in apology.
‘Anything broken?’ Sammy says.
She’ll lock them out.
But so what?
He throws his arm over Avery’s shoulder.
They’re height for height right now.
‘We are the kings of nowhere,’ Sammy says.
‘We only need us.’ He’s a very good liar.
The wallet is hot and heavy in Sam’s sweat-slick hands.
Sam has a headache.
From sun beating on his bare head?
From sleeping on the ground?
Except he doesn’t want to.
He just doesn’t care any more.
Seaglass necklaces and hand-painted bowls and boxes of postcards.
‘That’s ten for two, boy,’ the old woman says.
Three times what she asked for.
But they’re making him sick.
‘This OK?’ he says.
The first person to smile at him in days.
When is he going to understand that it’s over?
She slammed the door in his face.
What’s it going to take for him to stop?
The police to show up?
He should turn a few days into for ever days.
Do everyone a favour.
Come on, cut the self-loathing.
The scrolls of material fit nicely in two hands.
Pity he’s soaking them with sweat.
He needs to get himself together.
He’s an embarrassment.
Feet patter inside.
The doorhandles twist and then pauses.
She knows it’s him, doesn’t she?
‘Oh my God.’ Her voice is flat.
‘Because you, um, s-sew,’ he says.
‘Were you actually living upstairs like a creepy psycho?
Like … why?
I had nowhere to go, he wants to say.
I’m the boy of nothing and nowhere.
‘I checked with all my brothers.’ Moxie’s eyes narrows.
‘None of them knows you.
But that’s it.
She slams the door.
Sam leaves without another word.
The front door is open again.
She doesn’t call out after him.
But he notices the material is tucked under her arm.
‘Oh, boyfriend?’ the florist says.
‘I mean, she’s not my girlfriend.
The florist looks at him.
He’s scraping together twenty-cent pieces until he lifts another wallet.
Well, she’ll most likely do that anyway.
Why is he doing this?
This is all wrong.
The sympathetic look in her eyes startles him.
‘How mad are we talking?’ the florist says.
‘Because flowers send a message, you know.
He should’ve lifted another wallet.
Destroying more than fixing.
Sam left alone.
Yeah, OK, stop.
‘Well.’ Sam shakes the hair out of his eyes.
‘Which I’m not,’ Sam adds, quickly, looking up.
‘I’m not a creeper.
‘Ouch.’ The florist taps her manicured fingernails on the countertop.
‘I just want to say sorry.
I don’t …’ He swallows.
She folds her arms, surveying them.
Sam trails after her.
‘Chivalry is not dead!
And you’re kind of adorable.
‘Follow.’ He does.
‘I only have five dollars,’ Sam says.
The florist smiles.
He tried to take the florist’s advice.
He really tried.
But at least his tangles have been tamed?
And … a lot of glitter resurfaced.
Consequently he has the worst sunburn over his pale shoulders.
But he did an OK job, right?
That will not help.
Deep in the house, a baby wails.
Maybe she didn’t hear?
Her frown intensifies.
‘You,’ she says.
Possibly proof his intentions are honourable.
Possibly a shield.
Stand up straight.
Look her in the eye.
Don’t lose it.
‘I just want to say sorry,’ he says.
Which is exactly what he is.
He falls off with a shriek of laughter.
She hasn’t slammed the door.
He’s maybe got five seconds.
‘When you were away.
‘You all thought I was someone else’s friend.
So I stayed.
I swear it was an accident.’ Moxie’s scowl remains.
‘You lost me there.’ Moxie gestures to her shirt.
Gingerly, Sam offers the box of chocolates.
She takes the box.
‘And you’re not forgiven.’ But she took the chocolates.
Sam’s heart dares to beat again.
She looks curious.
She plucks a chocolate and bites.
Then flush out the pool.
Then fill it.
The hose is pointing at Sam.
Sam gets a faceful of water.
Laughing is good, right?
Because it seems she’s accepted the apology.
‘So you’re homeless,’ Moxie says.
Not like a question.
Sam’s caramel gets suddenly stuck in his throat.
‘Not around,’ he says.
I just – I make do.’ ‘In my house, clearly.
‘No.’ Moxie looks away again.
‘It was … it was my mum’s space.
He’s said the wrong thing.
‘No, my mum died.’ Moxie’s voice is strangely emotionless.
She … she had it after Dash was born too.
That’s why there’s like seven years between Dash and Toby.
Moxie doesn’t seem fazed.
But he doesn’t have conversational skills.
That’s … that’s exactly what it feels like.
‘Met properly,’ Moxie concedes.
Moxie looks pointedly at his arms.
‘I didn’t tell anyone that either.
‘I have to tell my dad the truth.
‘I’ll go.’ He knows this is the end.
Walking to nowhere.
‘Wait.’ Moxie stands too.
‘My dad could help you.
And there’s other stuff.
‘I can’t go to prison.
I just can’t.
He’d never cope.
Moxie chews her lip, her face strangely vulnerable.
I get it.’ There’s silence.
‘I can’t cook,’ Moxie says, very suddenly.
‘I burn everything.
It’s a literal nightmare.’ Sam remembers scrubbing the blackened pot.
‘Do you know how to make pancakes?’ she says.
He also pretends he’s not watching Moxie.
Moxie takes this in with thin lips.
‘You don’t seem like an axe murderer,’ she says finally.
And you were OK-ish that Sunday.’ ‘OK-ish?’ Sam repeats.
‘Oops.’ He turns huge brown eyes up at Sam.
Moxie has a very satisfied look on her face.
He flips pancakes.
And Sam makes a fine pancake.
They’re crisp around the edges and perfectly cooked inside.
Moxie tears a pancake in half.
‘I know you excel at dishes, so have at it.
‘No!’ Moxie eyeballs him.
‘Oh yes, sir.
He does feel bad for her.
He obviously has the easier job here.
For an easy grab and run.
Absolutely pitiful, Sam.
Scared of leaving.
His leg bounces.
He’s so close to Moxie and she smells of marmalade.
‘You made this?’ he says.
Moxie stretches her shirt out a little to admire it.
He never wants to go.
Sam’s smile is sheepish.
He can’t focus.
Sits beside him.
And she knows who and what he is.
‘No, you missed it.
Moxie’s body relaxes and her shoulder leans against his.
The pressure is warm and soft and everything.
And he falls into it.
Just a little.
But for the barest moment between patchwork frowns, he’s wanted.
He falls asleep.
How could he?
Sam snaps awake so fast that he swallows his heart.
Moxie is gone.
And the house is anything but quiet.
‘Dad said we’d knock off at three.
LANGUAGE.’ Sam is suffocating.
But this time he has nowhere to hide.
‘Jack perpetually smells like a sewer.
I was cutting timber with Dad.
Directly on to Sam.
Sam catches it with his face.
‘Oh,’ says Jack, backtracking to stare.
He has to run.
He has to run right now.
‘My friend Sam is staying for dinner,’ she announces.
‘And isn’t it Jack’s night to cook?
He narrows his eyes at Moxie.
‘Language.’ ‘Sorry.’ Moxie raises her hands innocently.
‘I’m overworked and underpaid,’ Jack says.
Moxie waves vaguely at the room.
‘Wait, he’s your friend?
‘Hmm, oops.’ Considering his recent decisions, she’s not wrong.
‘Let’s worry about that later.
‘You look tired, Sam.
But not on the topic she has in mind.
A dress dummy displays a pinned outfit of emerald green.
Moxie’s smile is wry.
Dinner is loud and messy and intoxicatingly alive.
Also because he’s far away from Mr De Lainey.
Sam just … he can’t with adults.
They frown, they shout, they hit.
Just in case.
The baby faceplants in a bowl of sauce.
Moxie pokes Sam’s leg under the table.
‘He’s the softest squish you’ll ever meet.
Sam shovels in food to hide the smile.
‘So, Moxie.’ Mr De Lainey clears his throat.
‘You’re taking my weekend now?’ Her father sighs.
‘Moxie …’ ‘Oh, it’s fine.’ Moxie’s teeth clench.
Moxie snatches her fork and stabs a meatball.
‘No,’ Moxie snaps.
‘No and no.’ The baby’s lip juts out.
‘Seriously, Moxie?’ Jack says.
‘You never have to look after them.
I’m only fifteen.
I’m a kid too.
‘All right, let’s calm down,’ Mr De Lainey says.
No one listens.
‘I never get to stop,’ Moxie shoots back.
‘Who got up for the baby last night?
‘Who’s been up since five with Toby?
But in that moment, his heart tugs for Moxie.
He gets it.
A life tangled with siblings who can’t look after themselves?
Sam gets it.
‘We all miss Mum,’ Jack says.
‘Grady,’ Mr De Lainey calls, sounding a little desperate.
‘Hey, just wait a —’ The front door bangs.
Mr De Lainey puts his head in his hands.
Jack snaps garlic bread in half.
‘Come on.’ It’s a command.
They sweep upstairs and leave the clatter of crying below.
But she doesn’t.
‘I’ve seen worse,’ Sam says.
He should not have said anything.
‘Long time ago.’ ‘OK, wow.
I am such a jerk.’ ‘No …’ Sam’s heart thuds.
It’s – you’re allowed to hurt.
‘I really miss my mum,’ Moxie says.
Sam looks out the window at the darkening sky.
‘I should go.’ Sam doesn’t move.
He thinks of the school.
He’d give anything to stay like this.
‘Just sleep in the office again,’ she says finally.
She presents fingers of glitter in proof.
He can’t do this.
He doesn’t know how.
Shouts and voices have dimmed as kids load into buses.
His shirt is inside out, collar popped, tags fluttering.
He looks happy.
Sammy stares at him.
‘I kissed Elle,’ Avery says.
Stop.’ Sammy pulls the paper out of his nose.
‘You’re talking way too fast.’ Not just talking.
He’s going way too fast for Sammy to keep up.
He’s going too fast.
He’s not like them.
He’s going to get hurt.
‘You can’t go around kissing.
Sammy tries to steady himself.
He’s not ready for this kind of conversation with Avery.
‘Because,’ he says, closing his eyes, ‘they’re messing with you.
To hurt you.’ Avery frowns.
Isn’t that nice for him?
His bottom lip juts out and he looks wounded.
‘I could earn money, right?
Sammy has the dull feeling that he’s being manipulated.
‘Did you say you’re going with them now?’ Sammy says.
Not the kind of people Sammy wants Avery around.
All crass jokes and cold smirks.
Does Sammy want Avery around anyone?
He picks friends badly.
‘You’re not going to anyone’s house,’ Sammy says.
‘We’re going back to Aunt Karen’s.’ Avery’s eyes narrow.
How’s Sam supposed to explain?
He doesn’t know how to let go of Avery.
Doesn’t think it’s the right time.
‘You can’t have both.
It’s like being a kid versus growing up.
A reason amongst millions that he’s not ready for this.
Avery pulls the toy car out of his pocket.
He flips it over with long thin fingers, staring.
Sammy tests his nose.
Avery bounces to his feet.
One waves him over.
Sammy’s fingers close over the toy car.
‘Please, just listen.
‘I mean,’ Sammy says, teeth grating, ‘under your clothes.
If clothes cover it, you can’t touch it.
It’s the rule, OK?
‘You hit people.
That’s worse than anything West does.
It’s bad, Sammy.
It’s so so bad.’ Sammy’s teeth clench.
‘I didn’t hit anyone.
I promised I’d stop, didn’t I?
They jumped me.’ Avery flicks his fingers by his ear.
He doesn’t belong to just you.
His smile is puppy-dog wide.
Innocent and anxiously excited.
West drapes an arm over his shoulder.
Laughs at him.
Or with him?
Sammy looks down at the toy car in his hand.
A tear hits it, hot and wet.
He’s stupid to be crying.
Their routine becomes pleasantly seamless after a week.
They come out faster the more he’s around Moxie.
Wow, he actually has opinions.
This could be you.’ Sam looks up, alarmed.
You’d need to cut your hair though.
‘But do you actually like it long?
Because you could just get it tidied.
He’s a sticky mess.
‘I’ll cut it.’ There’s a dangerous spark in her eyes.
Sam is decidedly nervous.
And he doesn’t want to see disgust in her eyes.
She ruffles fingers through his hair.
‘And what cities have you felled today?
You’re next, Jack.
‘He’s going to get the shower first,’ Jack says.
Jeremy clambers through the gate.
They’re friends … right?
Moxie snorts and waits till they’re gone before scooting closer.
Spiderwebs of sensations dart across his skull.
The scissors snip.
Wisps of corn silk strands drop on to Sam’s shoulders.
‘It would look so good on you.
But I’m …’ ‘Remarkably pretty.
She fluffs hair out from behind his ears.
Can she feel them burning hot?
Moxie jerks back.
‘Oh no.’ Sam’s shoulders straighten.
‘What do you mean “oh no”?’ ‘Um.’ Panic hits.
‘Moxie.’ ‘OK, OK, don’t stress.
I just …’ There’s a tense pause.
‘JEREMY,’ she hollers.
‘What’s going on?
Moxie.’ ‘I don’t understand,’ Moxie says.
‘I watched three tutorials.’ ‘That is confusing,’ Jeremy says.
Sam drops his face in his hands.
It’s considerably less exhilarating.
‘Shorter at the sides and longer at the top.
Sam’s going to be bald.
‘You have a buzz cut,’ Sam says, voice thin.
Moxie takes a bite of his sandwich.
‘Hey,’ he says.
‘He donated it to cancer kids.
How long did it get, Jeremy?
And totally unfocused.
Sam resists covering his ears in hopes of protecting them.
‘You were majestic,’ Moxie says.
A lot of hair.
‘Go find a mirror.’ ‘I don’t want to,’ Sam says.
It’s not too bad.
His head feels strangely naked and he can actually see.
‘Well, wow, Jeremy!
Then he notices Jeremy’s looking at his ribs.
‘It’s nothing.’ Sam looks away.
‘The ribs, however.’ ‘Unacceptable,’ says Jeremy.
‘He’s staying for dinner right, Moxie?
‘But really, Sam.
Any time.’ Sunshine crackles back into his eyes.
‘I’m making brownies.’ He ducks back into the house.
‘Make it caramel!’ Moxie yells at his back.
‘That was fun.’ Sam itches his neck.
‘Not really, no.’ ‘And you have a whole face.
She musses his hair again, frowning as she arranges it.
She’s so close, her hands all through his hair.
‘I like your eyes,’ she says.
She has no idea, does she?
What she does to his heart.
Sympathy is not her strong point.
He’ll check on him tomorrow.
Make sure he’s eating.
Make sure he’s not on the edge of a meltdown.
‘Mayfair,’ she crows.
‘Hey, don’t do that,’ Jeremy says, petting him tenderly.
‘Phone.’ Jack looks helplessly at Jeremy.
‘He started—’ His father snaps his fingers.
‘Soon,’ Moxie says fiercely.
His chest tugs.
Two weeks is a lot of lying.
‘OK, take it off,’ Moxie says.
‘Half the time they just text me anyway.
It’s like, expected.’ ‘Dad picks on me,’ Jack says.
Moxie reappears with an armful of garments.
‘Who do I kill with this?’ Sam says.
‘That’s an unpicker, you goat.
And these are second-hand clothes.
Jack makes an exasperated sound.
Sam swivels the small torture instrument.
It feels like a lock pick.
‘Since they’re all completely useless.’ ‘Excuse me,’ Jeremy says.
Last year, I think.’ ‘I rest my case,’ Moxie mutters.
Grady appears, rubbing his eyes until his glasses are askew.
‘What’d I miss?’ ‘Everything,’ Moxie says.
‘Why don’t you just buy clothes?
Save time.’ Moxie slams her scissors down, nostrils flaring.
‘Oh, here we go,’ Jeremy says.
Grady slides on to the bench across from Sam.
‘This seems unfair,’ Jeremy comments.
‘You can’t even cook.’ Moxie’s frown is lemon.
I can heat up lasagne.
I look after the kids all the time now.
Then she writes Jack and gives him a one.
Jack throws his Monopoly money.
The pen hesitates.
Then Moxie gives him an eight.
‘All right, this is rigged.’ Jeremy frowns.
‘I should be worth more than Sam.
His glare levels mountains.
‘Why are you rating Sam so high?
Moxie’s lemon frown is back.
‘Jack.’ Jack slams his hand against the wall.
‘Jack,’ the De Lainey father snaps.
Then he stomps upstairs.
He grins like a delighted Cheshire Cat.
Jeremy and Grady exchange smirks.
‘Sam is a lovely shade of red,’ Grady says.
‘He’s sunburnt.’ She cuts a sideways glance at Sam.
He wants to whisper, do you have a crush?
But his tongue is stuck, his breathing shallow.
It’d be so much worse if she did.
Boys like him don’t get the girl.
They go to jail.
It’s seven thirty in the morning.
He’s a mountain of a man, but flus don’t discriminate.
‘Dad,’ she says, ‘we’re totally out of food.
Moxie smiles at him, surprised and entirely pleased.
Drive me to the shops!’ Silence.
‘Jeremy cannot return your calls right now,’ he says.
Moxie narrows her eyes.
‘Did he come home last night?
‘Right, he’s grounded.’ He sneezes.
Moxie hands him the whole tissue box.
‘Where’s Grady?’ Jack bounces downstairs.
‘Then Jack can go shopping,’ Moxie says.
Panic lights Jack’s eyes.
But I’ve sunk a lot into it.
Too much.’ He rubs his reddened eyes.
‘Jack, can you grab the emergency cash in the office?
‘Just to tide us over.’ Jack folds his arms.
Mr De Lainey sighs.
Moxie snaps her fingers at Jack.
‘Get the money.
‘Dad needs a twelveyear nap.
The baby clings to her leg and sniffles.
Jack returns, car keys jingling.
He’s over keys.
‘I couldn’t find any money in the office,’ Jack says.
That’d be great, Sam.
I think I’m about to keep you.’ He smiles.
‘We’re going to live off gruel.’ Moxie’s voice turns dangerous.
‘Listen here, Jack.
Moxie’s smile is sweet poison.
Usually he fits with Moxie.
He bobs up and down awkwardly.
Jack eyes him and then snorts.
‘You look ridiculous.
It stops crying and looks interested.
Jack has a devilish spark in his eyes.
People jump clear with gasps.
The baby shrieks in delight.
Then Jack attempts to slow them down— and fails.
‘Ow,’ Sam says with a broken face.
The baby pats his cheek.
‘Ow-ow, Sammy.’ Moxie storms over.
He raises his arms in self-defence.
‘Jack’s idea.’ Moxie whirls on Jack.
‘You’re a terrible influence on him.
‘Why are you still smiling?
But his pockets are empty.
And Moxie said he was turning into a De Lainey.
Sammy is fourteen and there are knives in his belly.
He’s so hungry.
He’s fast now.
Fast at locks.
Slow to notice his brother cracking around the edges.
The bunk bed creaks.
A small thump.
‘I know you’re freaking out about something.
He could eat nine right now.
‘Is my brain broken?’ Sammy stiffens.
He stays very still.
‘They and the others … they copy me.
Like when I tic and—’ He stops.
‘They think I don’t get that they’re laughing at me.
But I do.’ ‘There’s nothing wrong with you.’ Silence.
‘Did they do something to you?
You have to tell me, OK?
He groans and knuckles his eyes.
‘I won’t hit anyone.
A shudder runs across Avery’s thin shoulders.
‘Avery?’ Sammy whispers.
‘Please talk to me.’ Avery starts to cry.
They come back with treasure.
Peculiar costumes to rip apart.
Strange tins of buttons.
Odd hats to remake.
He sold the desk from the office.
He hasn’t mentioned the missing money again.
Sam sifts through buttons.
Avery would love doing this.
Sam is consumed with sorting and nothing else.
Because this he can do.
This is safe.
Time to put on popcorn.
The keys stare at him with rows of metallic teeth.
The wallet is old, seams popping.
Just … don’t.
He sees Mr De Lainey’s disappointed eyes.
Avery’s understanding slice of a smile.
He owed everything to those keys.
Fingers shaking, he unhooks the house key.
He puts it in his pocket.
He doesn’t touch the wallet.
The pocketed key digs into his thigh.
whywhywhywhy what if they saw— Sam takes a breath.
No one saw.
Moxie will come down soon.
‘Saaaaammy,’ Jack says.
‘Sam.’ Jeremy pats Sam’s knee.
Sam does the logical thing – he panics.
They’ll see what a miserable pathetic creep he is.
Who steals house keys?
Who does that?
Mischief lights Jack’s eyes.
Then he stiffens right back up.
‘Since you’re here so much,’ Jeremy says.
This is worse than being caught with the key.
‘I haven’t …’ Sam says.
‘Dude, she has so.
Remember that kid with the glasses last year?
‘Sam is practically a live-in.’ They have no idea.
‘Shut up.’ Jeremy is calmly pleasant.
‘And you’ll kill me if I hurt her?
That’s cliché, guys.’ ‘Moxie can pound you herself,’ Jeremy says.
‘Why so complicated?
Just say we’ll kill him.’ ‘We’ll kill you,’ says Jack.
‘Bloodily.’ ‘Well, I’m not doing anything.’ Sam clutches buttons.
There’s a pause.
‘Sometimes the babies need helpful hints.
There’s a thump on the stairs and then Moxie appears.
Her brows tighten in that trademark lemon scowl.
‘We’re just giving him the safe sex talk.’ Sam chokes.
Jeremy whacks him helpfully on the back.
Moxie folds her arms.
Moxie is pure darkness.
‘Would you like to bet?’ ‘We’d tell Dad,’ Jack says.
‘You guys aren’t allowed to drink?’ Sam says.
Safe and strict.
So no drinking.
Or swearing.’ ‘Or sex,’ Jack adds.
Moxie smiles sweetly.
How could I forget?
All our friends thought we’d died.’ Jack looks like murder.
‘I hate you, Moxie.’ She batters her eyelashes.
I have stuff to do!
Moxie plops down beside Sam.
He resists the urge to close his fingers around it.
What’s wrong with him?
Sam’s voice is soft.
‘I guess you’ll have to tell them soon.
‘Lie down,’ she says.
His world grows crushingly tight.
He doesn’t know what to do.
What he’s allowed to feel.
She puts a hand on his chest.
Spreads her fingers out.
He’s holding Moxie.
He will never move again.
‘We should probably talk,’ Moxie says.
Sam closes his eyes.
I shouldn’t—’ ‘No.
I wouldn’t change a single day.
It’s been … it’s been perfect.
It sucked, OK?
And I want to scream.
He wants to be— something.
Someone to her.
Then I found you.
What does he say?
He doesn’t want it to end?
He doesn’t want to leave?
To lose her?
‘You snuck up on me, Sam.
I like you.
‘I like you quite a lot too,’ he whispers.
A smile curves half her lips.
‘AHEM.’ Moxie shrieks and falls backwards off the sofa.
Sam shoots upright, guilt plastered thickly on his face.
‘But Dad said Sam can spend the night.
So long as he calls his parents.’ He pauses.
‘He stays on the sofa.
While Moxie stays in her room.
Like he hasn’t been staying here for weeks.
Jeremy looks confused.
Wow, you weirdos.’ He turns to go and then backtracks.
‘I guess you don’t need advice, Sammy.’ He winks.
Sam pulls a pillow over his face.
Moxie shoots a suspicious look from one to the other.
‘Excuse me?’ ‘Nothing.’ Jeremy cheerfully flees.
‘It’s like I live here or something,’ he says.
‘It’s like you live here or something,’ she agrees.
Someone always smuggles alcohol and we light a bonfire.
It’s like the last holiday hurrah.’ ‘I … can’t.
If someone knows me—’ ‘No one’s going to know you.
No one will recognise him.
She smacks his chest.
Because, for starters, it’s a waistcoat.
‘Obviously,’ he says.
‘I’ll finish my dress,’ she says.
To being utterly invisible.
A shutter tips over her eyes.
‘Can we talk about it later?
We’ll work it out.
I’m not going to say goodbye.’ Her voice is fierce.
He wants to tell her everything.
That he steals keys because he’s desperate to belong.
She kisses him.
He tips his head up to catch it.
She’s soft and warm, summer nights and sugar.
His brain shuts off.
His hands circle her back.
He did something wrong.
Of course he did.
He screwed it— ‘I’m sorry,’ he’s saying, breathless and panicked.
‘Well, that I can tell.
Sam’s hands start to shake.
She tilts his chin up.
‘You have a lot of practice to do.
It’s OK to move your face, you know.
‘Perfect,’ she says.
Then kisses him again.
It matches her hair.
Blood and fire.
Her lips curl with disapproval.
Or hide her.
It tumbles out in anguish.
It’s never a tantrum.
Moxie’s fingers curl over Sam’s arm.
‘Who is she?
Engine still running.
She’s going to wake up the whole house.
‘I have to go.’ Sam turns to Moxie, desperate now.
‘Please, just …’ Just what, Sam?
Just what the hell will you tell her?
‘Tell me what’s going on!’ Moxie cries from the doorway.
He gets into Vin’s car.
All he has is a desperate need for Avery.
‘Tell me what happened.’ Sam’s voice is too high.
‘Where is he?
At your place?
Since he can’t shut up.
Vin’s only kindness is truly selfishness.
The car spins downtown.
‘He’s autistic.’ Sam grinds each word like crushed glass.
And you threw it all at him?
It’s like being hit in the stomach.
Sam rips out of his seat before they even stop.
He doesn’t hear Vin follow.
His own work.
His world is spinning out from under him.
He screams and screams.
They’ve pushed him too much.
‘No, just leave him alone.
I’ve got him.
Sam’s selfish fault.
His screams pitch higher.
Calm him down with pressure.
Avery’s fist connects with Sam’s stomach.
again Sam takes it all with the smallest grunt.
Sam doesn’t care.
‘You’re OK.’ ‘I c-c-c-can’t—’ ‘You don’t have to,’ Sam whispers.
‘I got you.
… embarrassing me, she’d said.
How’s he going to move Avery?
They have nowhere to go.
Life is always so sickeningly cruel.
Sam holds him tighter.
He knows where to go.
He can’t be doing this.
He’ll ruin everything.
He’s doing this.
He hates being this cruel.
Avery’s soul is bleeding out.
But they made it.
She’ll be furious he ran out like that.
Their kiss, so sweet before, feels like memories of ash.
The shirt is probably Jeremy’s.
Sam has so much stealing to apologise for.
‘I c-c-c-can’t …’ He stops.
A sob tears free.
Pressure to calm him.
Avery’s breathing slows as Sam holds him tight.
A sandwich of Lou boys in a stolen house.
‘We have to be quiet,’ Sam whispers.
‘But tomorrow I … I’m going to fix it.
No, the De Laineys are not like that.
Failing owning one, Sam decided to be one.
‘I’m … I’m sorry I wasn’t there.
Then he goes completely still.
A small sigh escapes.
Sam would save him a million times.
He’d never hesitate.
But you can’t hide Avery.
Sam’s perfect summer is a hot slap against his cheek.
He wakes to a toe in his ribs.
Sam jerks toward the sofa but it’s empty.
‘I need explanations,’ she says.
‘Many of them.
‘What the hell, Sam?’ He kneads his eyes.
‘My … my brother needed help.’ Where is he?
But I have to ask now, Sam.
‘Is this your autistic brother?
Is he safe right now?’ ‘I don’t know,’ Sam whispers.
‘We need to tell my dad,’ she says.
He opens his mouth to – what?
Maybe just agree?
Do you have an extremely cute and slightly taller doppelgänger?
Because one is currently abusing our poor gate.
Sam left his heartbeat inside.
But Avery’s OK.
‘Where’d you go?’ Sam says softly.
‘Come back inside.
His eyes are smudged with exhaustion, his lips bitten bloody.
‘If you tell, they’ll s-send you to jail,’ he says.
‘All … this?
Sunday night waffles.
Lying on the grass with mango pips.
Sam leans across the gate.
‘I’ll risk it for you.
I rebuilt her car.’ His split lips tip downwards.
‘Don’t be like that.’ Sam’s voice stays low.
‘You really can’t.’ Heat flares in Sam’s chest.
‘You just fall apart.
He looks wretched, tired and hollowed out.
Sam’s throat closes.
‘I like your hands better this way,’ Avery says.
Sam looks down in confusion.
His knuckles are smooth.
‘Vin says you’re soft.
‘You don’t belong in a house,’ Avery says.
‘We’re the kings of nowhere, remember?
No one can solve the puzzle that is Sammy Lou.
They shouldn’t even try.
‘You can call Vin if you need me.
But I’m leaving now.’ If he needs Avery?
More like when Avery needs him.
But he thinks Avery means it.
He thinks Avery’s trying to be a big brother.
Sam could laugh.
Or maybe just cry.
But he doesn’t.
‘After the beach party,’ Moxie says.
‘Then we’re officially talking to my dad.
About everything.’ He just nods.
No, he’s not.
Sam looks down at his fingers wrapped around Avery’s phone.
Sam stitches on a pretend smile.
But having dozens of eyes look at him?
He loathes that.
Six pairs of eyes immediately lock on Sam.
You look incredible.
The waistcoat is marvellous.
It’s burgundy and rust and charcoal and gold.
And it’s slim fitting.
No one will know.
He needs it.
No one has ever called Sam a gentleman before.
He can’t think about it right now.
Jack doesn’t look up from his phone.
‘The sun’s not fully down yet.
‘No,’ says Jack.
‘What have you been doing all this time?’ Moxie says.
Mr De Lainey pops raisins in his mouth.
‘Well.’ He pauses.
‘Well … you need pants.’ Jeremy looks down.
‘Oh, yeah.’ ‘And a different shirt,’ Jack adds, stealing gingerbread.
Jeremy nods several times and bolts back upstairs.
I need to wear a salmon.
OK.’ Moxie glances at Jack.
‘Does he have a new crush?
Is that why he’s flapping?’ Jack shrugs.
‘No.’ Jack puts his phone behind his back.
Their father sighs and looks very old.
Sam nudges Moxie with his knee.
Whatever that means.
But the dress has a secret.
The skirt flares out to a perfect circle.
She is the sun and her eyes burn stars.
Her smile is glory and pride and infectious delight.
Mr De Lainey looks like he’s about to cry.
‘Moxie, darling, you’re beautiful.
I’m taking a picture.
Everyone on the stairs!
They shuffle and poke each other.
Jeremy leans on Grady.
Dash picks up Toby.
A stray curl falls over Moxie’s eyes.
They share a smile.
It really, really hurts.
He can’t lose this.
The beach is a fairyland of lights like broken stars.
‘It’s mostly kids from school,’ Grady says.
‘And their friends and friends of friends.
The rich ones started it.
Rich kids get away with a lot.’ Sam won’t argue.
Sam ignores his tightening lungs.
Everything clashes together.
Don’t freak out.
No one knows you.
There is no way anyone here will recognise you.
‘Anyway, why are you saying “we”?
‘Loser.’ The crowd swallows them.
Grady lays a hand on Sam and Moxie’s shoulders.
‘I’m nineteen, not ninety.
And all my old school friends still come.
Also Isla’s here.’ He clears his throat.
‘So no drinking.’ ‘Obviously.’ Moxie folds her arms.
‘Don’t wander off someplace dark.’ Grady shudders.
‘Ha,’ he says.
Moxie slips her hand into his.
‘This rule I can do.
But seriously, are you OK, Sam?
You do look peaky.’ Oh, totally fine.
‘I’m fine.’ He is not fine.
He’s about to lose everything.
He is not fine.
‘That’s his girlfriend, Isla,’ Moxie says.
She’s super gorgeous too.
Obviously has no standards.
Anyway.’ She nudges Sam with her hip.
People shout Moxie’s name and compliment her dress.
Quite a few are barefoot.
Quite a few are drunk.
Absolutely no one is dressed like Moxie and Sam.
Absolutely everyone keeps looking at them.
Behind his back.
‘Hi,’ says Sam.
‘It’s confirmed,’ Kirby says.
‘And he helped me sew.
He did quite a lot actually.’ ‘Keep him,’ Kirby says.
Her cheeks flush and she talks fifty miles a minute.
This happyMoxie is a sparkling explosion of life.
Sam steps back a little.
It scares him.
They’re not marks and he’s not stealing.
He doesn’t fit here.
Take me home.
Firelight dances in her eyes.
They definitely don’t look ready to go.
‘I’m fine.’ He tries to smile.
‘Sad-eyed?’ Sam says.
Just a little.
She smiles at that.
‘Dance with me.
Music punches out of the speakers.
Moxie is all twirling arms and spinning rainbow skirt.
She catches Sam’s hands and he whirls her around.
He can’t dance.
He’s all elbows and knees.
He doesn’t care.
Let him embarrass himself.
Just so long as he’s with Moxie.
The song ends and Moxie collapses against him.
‘Permanently,’ he says.
‘Thanks for that, by the way.’ ‘You’re welcome.
It’s like the entire night sings goodbye.
He runs his thumb over her bottom lip.
He kisses her.
Sam will hold her.
It’ll all be fine.
Moxie sighs into his shoulder.
Kirby is jogging towards them, face pinched.
‘Hey!’ he shouts.
‘Is that Sammy Lou?’ Sam’s hands drop away from Moxie.
The boy releases Sam’s throat.
He still can’t breathe.
‘What the hell?’ Moxie snaps.
‘Don’t touch him.
Who are you?’ Kirby arrives, breathless.
‘Um, OK, whoa.
Let’s calm down.
Moxie, this is Griffin.
Erm, Griffin … Moxie.
Or maybe it’s the ocean.
He can’t quite hear through the roar.
He can’t quite see.
He needs to get out of here.
‘You want to explain yourself?
Or do I just start yelling for my brothers?
Sam’s stomach knots.
‘They go to that public school on the south side.
‘And don’t talk like that about his brother.
She doesn’t even know Avery.
This is the Moxie he loves.
Griffin barely glances at her.
West is in so much therapy now.
You know who this kid is?
He’s a raging psychopath.’ Sam looks at his hands.
Avery was screaming.
Those stupid, goddamn bullies.
That’ll stop you twitching.
All because Avery thought they were his friends.
They strung him along and then cut him down.
Sam was going to kill them.
He was going to kill them all.
Moxie turns to Sam.
Her face is closed, unreadable, eyes obsidian in the dark.
I’ll get your brothers, Moxie.’ She runs off.
‘You should be in jail!’ Griffin shouts.
People are gathering now.
‘Call the cops.’ ‘No!’ Moxie cries.
‘What else do I need to say?’ Griffin snaps.
Sam drops to his knees.
Air explodes out of his lungs and doesn’t come back.
Yells collide and someone calls out frantically for Moxie.
The knot of people tightens.
Sam holds his stomach.
He tastes tears.
Why didn’t you run?
‘Don’t you dare hit him,’ she shouts.
Griffin staggers a few steps and then spins on Moxie.
Hands shoot out.
Snatch at shirts.
Stop is whispered.
She gives the smallest cry.
Sam’s world speeds up.
You do not touch Moxie.
You do not ever ever ever touch Moxie.
To do what they know best.
He doesn’t think.
He has to stop.
There’s sand in his mouth, in his eyes.
Sam tries to breathe but he hasn’t lungs any more.
Sam jerks away.
Griffin holds his broken nose and roars.
Their faces blur and spin before him.
They are red teeth and burned-out eyes.
They are horror and disgust and rage.
Scared of him.
Just like he was so scared of his father.
Only one girl doesn’t move.
He runs past her.
Run, just run.
Just run for ever.
It hurts and he’s glad.
He’s so glad.
He wants to hurt.
He deserves it.
You despicable boy, his aunt said.
They’re all right.
He’s just like his father.
He should be in prison.
He picks himself up and runs down the road.
He pulls out Avery’s phone.
Fix all your problems.
‘Vin?’ He’s crying.
‘Vin, let me talk to Avery.
‘Avery’s busy right now.’ No.
‘Please, d-don’t do this.
I need him.
I need him.’ ‘OK, OK, calm down, kid.
I can barely understand you.
What happened?’ ‘I h-h-hit … I just h-hit—’ Sam shatters.
He’s sobbing now, the phone slipping against his cheek.
‘Tell me where you are.
I’ll come get you.’ ‘I want Avery.
Please, I w-want Avery.’ ‘I’ll get him for you, kid.
Just hold on.’ It’s an impossible command.
Sam has nothing left to hold on to.
Sam covers his face.
The driver’s door pops open and Vin gets out.
Tips Sam’s chin up.
There’s blood on his hands.
‘Is it yours?’ she says.
Sam shakes his head.
He’s hollowed out.
Vin hauls Sam to his feet.
Vin gets in and revs the engine.
‘Eat.’ Sam turns his head away.
‘I’m not messing about, kid.
‘I’m going to be sick.’ ‘No, you’re not.
You’re taking a bite.
Go.’ She revs the engine again.
‘I don’t want to hang around here.
Do you?’ Sam takes a bite.
He tastes blood and no chocolate at all.
She doesn’t comment.
Chocolate melts and smears on Sam’s fingers.
He wipes it on his jeans.
He looks at his waistcoat, Moxie’s amazing, detailed work.
Bloodstains stare back.
‘So Avery’s working,’ Vin says finally.
Chocolate help?’ Sam didn’t taste it.
But he’s not shaking any more.
He leans his head against the window.
‘I can’t … please.
I’ll sort it all out, you hear me?
The sob comes out unbidden.
Sam presses his arm over his mouth.
How much goes away?
The whole summer?
Nothing else.’ Vin spins the steering wheel.
Streetlights flash in Sam’s eyes.
She pulls up and shuts off the engine.
‘I can’t,’ Sam whispers.
Can he even walk right now?
‘You do it, or I throw you to the cops.
Help me and I fix everything.
It’s not a decision.’ Sam swallows.
‘Get out of the car,’ Vin says.
Sam gets out of the car.
They walk three blocks.
She has a black duffle bag slung over a shoulder.
Sam has to admit – Vin knows what she’s doing.
There’s a sense of safety in that.
This is why Avery keeps working for her, isn’t it?
He wants to be safe, same as Sam.
He doesn’t want to be like this.
He focuses on Vin’s heeled boots.
Sam has no idea what time it is.
‘What is this place?’ His voice is low.
‘I have a contact overseas.
It’s an easy ten grand.’ ‘Ten grand?’ Sam stares.
Vin’s red lips twitch.
‘You get a cut, little angel.
Avery says you’re obsessed with having a house.
We can work something out.
If you stay on.
Keep working for me.’ Sam shifts his gaze away.
He wouldn’t – he can’t— He doesn’t want this.
He doesn’t want to admit he would fit.
He wants to forget what he’s good at.
Fists and theft.
‘See that window?
So they could fly.
Avery shouldn’t tell stuff like that.
It belongs to him and Sam.
‘I can.’ Sam’s mouth is dry.
She gives him a pair of thin gloves.
It’s not cold.
‘You just flip the off switch,’ she says.
Then unlock the back door.
Use your phone for light.
Easy, kid, so easy.
She tugs out her phone and frowns at the screen.
‘I’ll take this.
You got it?’ Sam nods.
Even Sam winces.
Don’t think about it now, Sammy.
Take a breath.
The building is tall and the window looks impossibly tiny.
He glances back.
Vin makes an angry flicking motion.
His fingers crawl across bricks.
It shudders under his weight, but he just moves faster.
Fast, boy, go fast.
His heart crashes hard in his chest.
Don’t look down.
Don’t look for Vin.
After this, he gets Avery.
He gets to hide.
It crashes to the floor inside.
The sound is an explosion over the empty car park.
He can’t see Vin.
His shoulders only just wedge through.
Don’t think about falling.
He flips down, silent as death.
He walks the halls.
Avoids the cameras.
Gets to the back door.
He shuts down the light, the camera, the alarms.
Once he unlocks that door, this place is Vin’s.
This is real and it’s big.
His fingers are red, a poisoned stain.
Moxie screams ‘Sam’ in his ears.
Not angry – frightened, desperate.
He feels hot.
He’s going to throw up.
He slides down the wall, holding his face.
Tears spill between his fingers.
If he does this, it’s the beginning, not the end.
And he will never see Moxie again.
He did that himself.
The doorknob jiggles and then there’s an urgent hiss.
‘Sammy.’ Sam hugs his legs tighter.
Are you there?
Won’t do it.
Can’t can’t can’t— The doorknob rattles again and Vin swears.
Open – this – door.’ Sam hits dial.
Emergency picks up.
‘Please,’ Sam whispers, giving the address of the art gallery.
‘It’s being robbed.
He’s out of time.
‘She’s going to kill me.’ He ends the call.
More than one set.
Sam’s heart skips a beat.
Vin’s is acid.
I had to come!
Avery can’t be here.
Sam just called the goddamn police.
He isn’t thinking.
Just let there have never been a Sammy Lou.
He leans his cheek against the cold door.
He has to get Avery out of here.
Nothing else matters.
Sam flips the lock.
Avery’s voice is high and trembling.
‘Who would know—’ ‘The kid,’ Vin snaps.
‘The kid has a phone.
Sam doesn’t stop.
Blue and red lights flash on the street.
‘Run!’ Vin gasps and pelts after Sam.
There’s a brief hesitation and then Avery takes off too.
They pound after him.
Chasing him or just getting away?
His lungs scream.
Sam hits the ground and keeps running.
But Avery trips.
And then Vin is on top of him.
Vin has Avery’s arm.
‘You dropped the bag of money, didn’t you?’ Vin says.
‘Our whole night’s work.’ She throws Avery on the ground.
Sam takes a step forward.
Vin’s lips peel back in a vicious smile.
Avery’s cry cuts the numb walls around Sam.
Red heat pours into Sam’s eyes.
He sags to his knees, hands to his head.
Vin picks something up from the piles of alley rubbish.
A broken piece of plywood spiked with bent rusted nails.
Avery scrabbles to get up.
I-I-I—’ Vin cracks the pole across Avery’s stomach.
He falls back down with a cry.
He needs it to stop spinning, please stop spinning.
‘You’re next, Sammy.
It catches Avery across the shoulder blades with sickening thwack.
He never runs.
Sam leaps forward.
Avery’s sob is broken.
Sam’s cry is blood.
She lands a punch on Sam’s jaw.
He raises his fist to her face.
Twice in one night his soul spills red.
But he can’t do this.
A sob ravages Sam’s chest.
He doesn’t want to do this any more.
Vin’s fingers claw at Sam’s waistcoat.
He’s not going to hit any more.
His world shudders.
He looks down.
He opens his mouth.
One bright spear of pain.
Behind him, Avery wails.
High-pitched and childish and terrified.
Vin drops into a crouch in front of Sam.
Vin’s face fills his whole vision.
He falls for ever.
He is going to die.
Avery catches his head before he hits the cement.
It runs thick and red.
So much of it.
It doesn’t really hurt.
Sam tries to tell Avery that.
Don’t cry, Avery.
‘I n-n-need you.
You c-c-can’t …’ His voice breaks.
‘Avery.’ Sam’s fist curls in Avery’s shirt.
The alley is quiet.
Vin is gone.
His stims get tangled when he’s upset.
Sam is so very good at making people upset.
No one hears.
No one comes.
Sam tries to cough but it hurts too much.
The pain is here, finally.
‘I’ll buy you a hundred houses.
I swear, I’ll do a-a-a-anything.
‘Don’t leave.’ But Avery’s already letting go.
Then it’s quiet.
Sam tries to put the pieces of himself together.
Tries, with cotton and screws and wishes.
But doesn’t he deserve this?
His ribs folds inwards as everything inside him shudders.
The boy turns invisible.
As he should be.
They try to pry his fingers open.
He’s too weak to stop them.
‘No, wait!’ Avery’s voice is panicked, words tripping over themselves.
‘Don’t take it.
We’ve got this.
He needs it!
Listen to me, listen, just—’ They leave Sam’s fingers alone.
‘What’s he holding anyway?’ ‘A key.
They need to understand the key.
If lost, please return to the De Laineys.
Sammy is fourteen and full of broken pieces.
He’s been here for a long time.
If he goes in, she’ll call the cops.
After what he did to those boys at school.
Or maybe that’s the wind.
Or maybe that’s him.
Being smashed to pieces.
Blood and broken bone and hollowed-out eyes.
And the screaming.
When they catch Sammy, they’ll take him away.
He deserves it.
He always goes too far.
He’ll die in prison.
He’ll die without Avery.
The curtain rips back and Avery’s there, eyes melting pools.
‘C-c-can you get my jumper?’ Sammy whispers.
The curtain falls and there’s a brief scuffling.
‘If Sammy’s there, I’m calling the cops!’ she shouts.
‘Come back inside, Avery.
You’ll get your cast wet.
‘Sammy.’ It’s a sob.
‘Hey.’ Sam clutches him, a drowning boy.
‘Hey – h-hey, you’ll get your cast wet.
He’s only just out of hospital.
‘I can’t.’ Sam glances desperately at the door.
Has she called the cops already?
I’m going to … I’m running away.’ ‘OK,’ Avery says.
‘I won’t have anywhere to live.
I’ll … I’ll steal.
I’ll steal houses.
Tears and rain.
And me,’ he says.
‘We.’ He’s too soft, they always said.
He shifts on the pillows, his eyelids swollen and sticky.
A chair scrapes.
Sheets rustle as elbows leans forward.
His fingers fold over it automatically.
‘They took it off you during surgery.
But you have it back now.
It’s OK, Sammy.’ Sam drags his eyes open.
His face feels stung and swollen, his throat flayed raw.
He looks terrible.
His clothes are gone.
Moxie’s waistcoat is gone.
He ruined it.
All her work.
She’ll yell at him for six days solid for— Oh.
There is no more Moxie.
There will be no more Moxie.
He wants Avery to deny it.
‘Yeah,’ says Avery, voice thick.
‘I’m sorry, Sammy.
I-I-I had to tell them everything.’ Oh.
But he just feels numb.
‘You had stitches,’ Avery says.
‘But it went in deep so … surgery.
It took a while.
‘I’m supposed to get the nurse when you wake up.
Do you hurt?
How bad?’ Bad.
‘I’m OK.’ Sam closes his eyes.
Sam puts a hand on Avery’s head.
‘I don’t think so.
Avery scrubs his eyes with the hem of his T-shirt.
‘Sammy, what was I supposed to do?
I couldn’t let you die.’ He’s going to jail.
A small part of his heart is glad.
He’s so tired.
Sammy – I can’t.
I need you.
‘I lied when I said I didn’t.
You know that, right?
I LIED —’ ‘Hey, hey, shh.
I know.’ Sam stretches out his fingers, brushing Avery’s wrist.
‘Have you slept?’ Avery shakes his head, whole body trembling.
‘My hands are going like a psycho,’ Avery says.
You need to move.
It’s OK.’ Avery whimpers.
‘Is this OK?’ Avery says.
‘I can move.’ ‘Don’t leave.’ ‘I’m not leaving.
‘I’m not leaving,’ Avery says.
The trick is to keep quiet.
The trick is to hold on to Avery.
It’s the falling.
Sometimes he can’t take a deep enough breath.
He won’t eat.
It’s been twenty-four hours, and he’s so, so sore.
It just slips back down.
They don’t want to see him as a child.
He curls tighter into a ball.
‘Excuse me, but you can’t be in here.’ Sam tenses.
‘But it says family, right?
I’m family.’ ‘Uh.
You look nothing like—’ ‘Oh, just five minutes.
I’ve run across the entire city to find him.
Let me see her.
It’s a fist to Sam’s already pulverised stomach.
‘How could you?’ He shrinks against the pillows.
‘What you did?
It’s you—’ She stops.
It’s you who’s the monster.
An ocean away.
‘We looked everywhere.
She lays her hands in her lap.
Doesn’t look at him.
‘I told my dad everything.
He wants to curl under it completely, disappear.
Her voice is tight.
‘Dad said he could’ve helped.’ Too late now.
‘He couldn’t.’ Sam’s heart punches holes in his chest.
And you don’t deserve to be caught?
Look what he did.
Look at his hands.
She slips a phone from her pocket.
Sam’s mouth is cotton and ash.
‘Just leave it, OK?
All waif and damp eyes and fluttering fingers.
‘And your brother?’ Moxie says, stiff now.
How is he going to help you?
You said he needs help.’ He does.
‘We’ll be fine.’ Sam rubs his knuckles over his eyes.
But at least she didn’t call anyone.
And then … then what even happened?’ Sam feels sick.
‘I got stabbed.’ Moxie’s eyes widen.
But she doesn’t.
By who?’ Sam closes his eyes.
‘Someone who hit Avery.’ Sam rubs his eyes again.
They keep filling up.
He’s so soft.
The trick is to not be so soft.
‘I’m sorry,’ he whispers.
‘I’m so so sorry.’ Moxie backhands her eyes furiously.
‘I know Griffin hit you first.
But … Sam, you scare me.’ He scares Avery too.
He scares himself.
I want to stop, he could scream.
I don’t want this to be my forever.
This is infinitely worse.
And even then, would it be enough?
Sam’s insides turn to ice.
Moxie pushes sweaty hair out of her eyes.
She turns to the social worker.
‘No visitors for my client.
Have the hospital staff notified.
She mouths, Let me help.
Sam gives the tiniest shake of his head.
Sam bunches his fists in the blankets.
He needs Avery.
They’re not going to let him have Avery.
The social worker holds out his hand to shake Sam’s.
‘Emery Evans,’ he says.
‘And this is your lawyer, Celia Polnik.
He has no words.
Can’t they see?
His thin chest moves raggedly.
Maybe a girl woke him on her way out.
‘OK,’ Avery says, ‘OK, I’m here.
Possibly a nap.
Possibly he could never wake up.
His fingers brush over the bandages taped to his stomach.
Or how often he screams himself awake at night.
No one knows what to do with him.
Avery, so far, slips through the cracks of everyone’s attention.
Sam pulls himself upright.
He seems satisfied.
‘Get your shirt.
Evans brought the clothes in earlier.
Ruined with blood and sliced by the knife.
They threw it out.
Don’t think of the waistcoat.
You’re not allowed.
You don’t deserve to.
‘Avery isn’t back yet,’ Sam says.
The man is all spider-thin fingers and a disapproving mouth.
‘He might not make it in time.
‘We’re not waiting.’ Sam understands.
Evans did this on purpose.
When Avery’s sleeping.
When Avery’s gone to try and find Aunt Karen.
Then his spider fingers will be all over Sam’s brother.
But he doesn’t want Avery at the courthouse.
But Sam can’t go without him.
He’s so empty.
Stars and buttons and caramel truffles.
Locked from the outside.
Evans’s car purrs smoothly through the city.
‘Am I going to jail?’ Sam says at last.
‘I can’t predict the judge.’ A non-answer.
Sam should be used to those.
Evans doesn’t notice.
‘You will eventually.
He’s ripping apart.
‘I need air,’ he whispers.
Then louder, ‘I need the window down.
Sam unbuckles his belt and puts his whole head out.
‘Sit back down,’ Evans commands.
Evans yells at his back.
‘You can’t afford to do this!’ Evan shouts.
Sam tucks his head and swerves amongst cars.
His shoes hit the sidewalk.
You have to get out of here.
Blood blooms across the white like spilt paint.
He’s good at running away.
It’s like ripping stitches.
It’s like the knife going in again and again.
He throws his tie away.
His legs know the destination even before his mind does.
Walk, Sammy, just walk.
They said they would help.
The sun bathes the world in dusky blues and pinks.
He slumps into the gutter in front of the house.
It’s late enough that everyone will be home.
Jeremy is probably cooking – it’s his night, isn’t it?
Toby is probably drawing on a wall.
Grady is reading and bossing everyone around.
Moxie is Moxie is Moxie is Moxie hates him.
Sam rests his face on his knees.
This house will never be his.
It tastes of cooler days and the end of summer.
It had to end.
Boots hit the footpath behind him.
He keeps his face pressed in his knees.
‘Sam.’ The voice is softness and sorrow.
Mr De Lainey drops down into the gutter beside Sam.
He doesn’t touch him.
He doesn’t look at his face.
He never wanted those disappointed eyes on him.
Why did Sam come back?
‘You’re lying.’ Sam shrinks into himself a little further.
But Mr De Lainey’s voice isn’t angry.
‘I know you’re looking for something, Sam,’ he says.
‘I know you found it here.
‘A family.’ His voice dries in his throat.
I know I know I know.
But the gaze before him is just sad and tired.
No more hiding and running.
You need help, real help.
They stay like that for a minute or a year.
‘And then you can let me know what we’re doing.
I won’t stop you if you leave.
‘I don’t want to go in,’ Sam says.
The sewing machine shuts off.
Sam takes a step towards the window.
He raises a trembling hand and taps the glass.
Moxie looks up.
Her hair is caught in a frizzy bun.
A scowl fits over her lips, all vinegar and suspicion.
When she sees him, the scowl falters.
Her lips part in surprise.
He pushes away from the window.
He deserves that.
All of it.
He should just walk away now.
Steal another house.
But he doesn’t doesn’t doesn’t want to.
Something like fear.
She doesn’t walk to him, she flies.
He expects a slap.
And she hugs him.
His arms slip around her back.
She is endlessly warm, like hugging waffles with honey.
‘I’m angry,’ she says fiercely.
‘I’m angry at you but I also care so much.
I told you that, didn’t I?
‘How dare you get stabbed?’ ‘I’m nothing,’ he says.
‘I’m sorry.’ She glances down then and sees his shirt.
She gives a sharp intake of breath.
‘You stupid beautiful boy.
Go sit on the steps.
Right now.’ Then she spins and runs inside.
Sam does as he’s told.
Then she unbuttons Sam’s shirt.
Blood soaks her fingertips.
He’s so cold.
He gets stuck lifting his arms high enough.
It’s Jeremy’s shirt, a superhero emblazoned on the front.
‘I’m sor—’ ‘No, don’t say sorry again.
‘I’m not Goldilocks.
I’m the monster in the woods.
I can’t stop myself.
And I don’t like it … I hate it.
I hate it.
I deserve jail.
She takes his hands and their fingers fit together.
It’s so, so unfair.
It’s salty tears and bloody memories and empty boxes.
She tastes of longing, he of tears.
Her eyes are wet when she smiles.
They look up.
‘Sammy.’ He gasps for breath.
‘And you’re just kissing – in the sunset?
Jeremy squeezes past the others on to the veranda.
‘Hey, the return of the second Sammy.’ He nudges Jack.
‘He looks like a wild sort of elf.
A lost boy from Peter Pan.’ Jack snorts.
‘I think he swam here.’ ‘I ran,’ Avery growls.
Avery seems to have regained his breath.
‘And then Sam’s deciding if he’s going back or not.
Sam snaps his gaze to Mr De Lainey.
What is he doing?
‘I work in construction,’ Mr De Lainey says.
‘I have my own business.
The De Lainey father gets it.
Avery just stares.
But he sets his jaw and doesn’t shrink away.
‘What about Sam?’ Avery says.
‘That’s if Sam chooses to go back to court.
Finally he swears.
Jack gives a low whistle.
‘Dinner’s in five minutes.
Avery, come inside and get some water.
Well, she did.
Just a little.
She matches his look, blade for blade.
‘It’s a joke,’ Sam says.
‘You’ll like their food.
‘You shut up.
You scared me to death, you know that?
All his people are here.
Everything he loves.
‘Would you?’ he says.
‘Would you stay?
Sam is tired.
Sam can’t do this any more.
It folds over him.
Dishes and voices clash behind them.
Then he sets a phone next to Sam.
The phone might as well be another knife.
Except maybe he won’t be alone for ever.
So Sammy Lou picks up the phone.
The whole team at Orchard Books!
Thank you for your advice and flails!
You have been a mountain of encouragement.
Except you, Jemima.
At the wrist would be best.
How sick is that?
He’d be a scene out of a horror movie.
And he’d be free.
Because, without hands, he’s worthless to her.
To the Maestro.
He won’t even try something like that.
A taste of fudge and freedom isn’t worth it?
He’s just not made for rebellion or risks.
Fantasising is all he’s good for.
Sick dreams of mutilation, apparently.
Which hand would he even cut off?
It scares Beck Keverich – the way he thinks sometimes.
His digital clock reads 5:12.
And he should’ve been up twelve minutes ago.
Beck peels his head off the pillows.
He wishes he could dissolve into them.
Did he even sleep last night?
His wrists ache like he’s been juggling blocks of cement.
Did he quit at eleven?
His fingers moan, it was midnight, you fool.
His fingers are cantankerous like that.
He slams the piano lid open.
The Steinway upright is the sole glory of his room.
Not that there’s much else in the room.
Although her curled lips and glares also speak volumes.
Schreckliche means terrible.
It’s a summary of Beck.
You are an awful pianist.
Your music has no future.
You have no talent.
Why don’t you play faster, better, clearer?
Why do you hit the wrong notes all the time?
Now for staccato notes.
Double fifth scales.
Diminished seventh exercises.
Trills for his iced fingers to fall across.
By 8 a.m.
Of walking out and never coming back.
Play the music on the paper.
No one cares about the songs in your head.
She’s exhausting just to look at.
‘IT’S FIFTEEN MINUTES TILL WE GO,’ Joey bellows.
He can hear, he just can’t multitask and answer.
He hates these pieces the Maestro demands he learn.
It’s past eight.
He’s not even dressed or had breakfast.
Joey’s face puckers.
‘I made you lunch,’ Joey says, spider-climbing up his doorframe.
‘A surprise lunch.
She gives an indignant squeak and drops from the walls.
She’s giggling before he even starts to beg.
‘Don’t punish me.
‘I’m a scrumptious cook.
The ‘comprehension’ was, of course, nonexistent.
Hence Beck was late to pick up Joey.
There’s a state championship coming up to obligingly stress everyone.
‘OK, calm down.
My delicate self-worth can only take so much.
He removes it.
‘I’m sorry I play the same song so much.
I’m – practising.
Predictably, breakfast is cornflakes with a side dish of disapproval.
Who is Beck kidding?
That shade of yellow never looked good.
She tutors musicianship and theory at the university.
Beck wonders how often her students cry.
Beck slinks past, telling himself he did everything right.
She has nothing to erupt about.
It’ll be OK – totally OK.
With milk, it’ll become sludge.
Beck watches the Maestro’s red pen whip over the music.
Beck checks the plastic bag with his squashed sandwich.
Joey has a thing about making his lunch.
Maybe he’d rather not know.
‘You’ll be late.’ The Maestro’s voice is deep and raspy.
Preschool is blissfully free of dress regulations.
They have to do this now?
Joey kicks the front door open with her glittered gumboots.
‘I’m gonna beat you there!’ she yells.
‘Ja, Mutter?’ He uses German as a tentative appeasement.
Painfully slow seconds tick by like swats against Beck’s face.
He has to get out.
Needs to leave.
‘You woke late,’ the Maestro says.
‘I’m sorry.’ Suck up.
It’s the only way to get out alive.
The Maestro snorts.
‘Why are you inept at dedication and commitment?
It trembles violently and coffee sloshes over the side.
Which is highly likely.
He doesn’t like her to cross the road alone.
‘Ja, of course you are sorry.
A little parrot with only one phrase to say.
He doesn’t want to do this again.
He’s going to be late.
Her hand flashes out of nowhere and slaps his face.
The shock of it sends him a step backwards.
He always forgets how fast she can move.
‘Do not disrespect me!’ she snaps.
‘School is not important.
I am speaking to you.
That is important.’ Beck does nothing.
‘The piano is life.
You shame my name.
You’ll amount to nothing, Sohn, nothing!
Are you listening?’ ‘Yes, Mutter.’ Beck speaks to his shoes.
‘Is my advice a joke to you?
LOOK AT ME WHEN I SPEAK.’ Also by C.G.

I’ve always needed both.
Most people exist, that’s all.
—Oscar Wilde September 5, 2017 MATEO TORREZ 12:22 a.m.
Not that I will ever know for sure.
I’m going to .
My chest tightens.
I’m dying today.
I’ve always been afraid of dying.
Wow, I’m actually .
I don’t want to pick up the phone.
The caller ID reads DEATH-CAST, of course.
I’m shaking but manage to press Talk.
I don’t say anything.
I’m not sure what to say.
“Hello, I’m calling from Death-Cast.
You there, Timothy?” Timothy.
My name isn’t Timothy.
“You’ve got the wrong person,” I tell Andrea.
I truly do.
“Mateo, kindly confirm this is indeed you.
She has no sympathy to offer me.
It’s basically Twitter for Deckers.
.” I’ve only ever been to one funeral.
If I had more friends than I do fingers.
I sink to the floor, on my knees.
And that’s it.
No one has ever wronged me.
Really, I do.
I’m such a paranoid mess.
Maybe he’s dating someone, and maybe he likes that company.
But I will never grow up to be Future Mateo.
Not even that.
Do, and then die.
I’m not going to tell anyone.
No one should spend their last hours second-guessing people.
wow, the last time ever.
I’ll be gone before I can adjust to my mortality.
I also have to see Lidia and her one-year-old, Penny.
Short answer: He isn’t.
I won’t even be a ghost to her.
I haven’t worn it outside yet.
At least I could fall asleep during my free periods.
I shouldn’t have taken those frees for granted.
It’s 12:58 a.m.
It’s 1:00 a.m.
I can’t believe I’m never returning to my bedroom.
I shake my head and slam the door shut.
RUFUS EMETERIO 1:05 a.m.
But nothing, just my phone.
“You gotta pick it up, Roof,” Tagoe says.
“The hell I do,” I say.
These Death-Cast calls go strong until three.
I don’t know either.
My phone stops ringing.
“Maybe it was a mistake,” Malcolm says.
My phone rings again.
Malcolm stays shut.
I wasn’t hopeful.
And we Emeterios haven’t exactly been lucky with staying alive.
But meeting our maker way ahead of time?
We’re your guys.
“Maybe he got a weapon on him,” Malcolm says.
But I’m not betting my life, not like this.
I drop my phone.
I stand and he stays down.
“Who you calling for?” His neck twitch surprises no one.
“Hold up, hold up.
I ain’t him.
Wait a sec.” He holds out the phone.
“You want me to hang up, Roof?” I don’t know.
“Watch him,” I tell Tagoe and Malcolm.
I don’t know how I became the alpha dog.
I ended up in the foster home years after them.
“You’re calling after one.” It’s bullshit.
Other Deckers got their alert an hour ago.
“Yes, you’re right.
I’m sorry,” Victor says.
First of all, how are you doing?
It took a while for you to answer.
“Just tell me my options.” This should be good.
“How do you guys know?” I interrupt.
“The End Days.
How do you know?
Screw this guy.
“Yo, Victor, be a person for one minute.
I don’t know if you know, but I’m seventeen.
Three weeks from my eighteenth birthday.
“You want me to be a person, Rufus?
Rufus, I feel for you, I do.
Can you do me a solid and cooperate?” Damn.
The damage is done—will be done.
Today is my End Day, a straight-up Rufus Armageddon.
I don’t know how this is gonna go down.
I’m praying I don’t drown like my parents and sis.
Maybe Peck is gonna be responsible for this.
I walk back over to the three of them, fast.
“You didn’t ‘beat’ me, okay?
Not much life left.
“You feel me?” Peck nods.
Malcolm stomps it out.
“Get the hell out of here.” Malcolm grabs my shoulder.
“Don’t let him go.
I shake Malcolm off my shoulder.
“I wasn’t gonna kill him.” Malcolm and Tagoe are quiet.
I can’t stop shaking.
I could’ve killed him, even if I didn’t mean to.
But I’m not hard.
I storm toward our bikes.
He nods again, no twitch this time.
“You two are straight-up shadows,” I say.
“That because we’re black?” Malcolm asks.
“Because you’re always following me,” I say.
“Loyal to the end.” The end.
That shuts us up.
“Let’s go home,” I say.
And we out.
MATEO 1:06 a.m.
I’m not naive about dying.
I know it’s going to happen.
But I don’t have to rush into it.
I’m buying myself more time.
The Decker was twenty-two-year-old Keith.
I don’t know how Keith died.
I don’t know.
Except there is, it just exists in magnetic vibrations.
I switch to the Neptune track.
RUFUS 1:18 a.m.
We’re riding to Pluto in the dead of night.
But right now, all that matters is we’re still together.
The building is massive, with off-white bricks and maroon steeples.
Doesn’t matter anyway.
I climb off the bike, throwing down the kickstand.
This woman has gotta be a Decker, or know one.
The graveyard shift here is no joke.
I call Aimee.
It rings six times before going to voice mail.
I call again and it’s the same thing.
She’s ignoring me.
I type out a text: Death-Cast called me.
Maybe you can too.
Nah, I can’t be a dick and send that.
I correct myself: Death-Cast called me.
Can you call me back?
“Hey.” “Are you serious?” Aimee asks.
“I’m with Malcolm and Tagoe.” “Why aren’t you at Pluto?
“We’re headed back to Pluto now.
Can you meet us there?” “What?
I’m getting dressed, do not move.
“Meet me at home.
get to me.
Bye, Aimee.” I hang up before she can protest.
“What’s the plan?” Malcolm asks.
“We’re going back to Pluto,” I tell them.
Or maybe that’s how it has to be.
MATEO 1:32 a.m.
Scrolling through CountDowners is a very serious downer.
No one; good.
I randomly select a Decker.
I’m sure he’ll get through okay.
I switch to another feed.
I have to visit Dad, even if he’s unconscious.
Well, Dad did all the work.
I was laughing at him.
I swear this isn’t an excuse to not go outside.
RUFUS 1:41 a.m.
We’re on the block with that Decker-friendly club, Clint’s Graveyard.
There’s the fireplace that doesn’t work but still looks dope.
“You’ve come really far.
I’ll be lucky to get twelve hours.
“What, it’s true!
“You guys gotta do me the biggest favor.
Wake up Jenn Lori and Francis.
“You should stay here,” Malcolm says.
He opens up the only closet.
“Maybe we can beat this.
You can be the exception!
I sit up.
I can’t let them see me freaking.
“I’m not offing myself,” I say.
I’m not trying to die.
Those were mad chill times.
Like I still have a chance with her.
We keep it simple here.
Walking out of here .
I really don’t wanna go.
MATEO 1:52 a.m.
I’m almost ready to go.
How do I sum up my life in eight words?
He Lived Where He Died: In His Bedroom.
What a Waste of a Life.
Children Take More Risks Than Him.
I have to do better.
Everyone wanted so much more out of me, myself included.
I have to honor this.
It’s my last day to do so.
Here Lies Mateo: He Lived for Everyone.
I hit Submit.
There’s no going back.
I can’t do this alone, the leaving part.
I’m really not dragging Lidia into my End Day.
But it’s not always sweet like that.
Time is wasting.
I download the Last Friend app on my phone.
Dying Today Not Dying Today I click Dying Today.
A message pops up: We here at Last Friend Inc.
are collectively sorry for this loss of you.
Please fill out the profile for best results.
Deeply sorry to lose you, Last Friend Inc.
A blank profile pops up and I fill it out.
I want to make him proud and break out.
After that, I don’t know.
Final Thoughts: I’m going for it.
I submit my answers.
The app prompts me to upload a photo.
There’s my junior year photo, which is lame.
But I was wrong, go figure.
RUFUS 1:59 a.m.
My foster parents are waiting downstairs.
I grab my helmet because safety first.
I take one last look at the room.
Malcolm gives me a little smile.
I would too if the cards were reversed.
“You actually got Francis awake?” I ask.
I follow Malcolm downstairs.
Francis is too white to rock a fade, though.
“One less mouth to feed, right?” No one laughs.
I don’t know how to do this.
It takes another minute, but we get several rounds going.
Francis and Jenn Lori are easy to beat.
I go up against Tagoe and Rock beats Scissors.
“Do-over,” Malcolm says.
I give Tagoe a friendly bro push.
“Because you’re a dick.” The doorbell rings.
“Are you kidding me?” Aimee asks.
I shake my head.
MATEO 2:02 a.m.
19 years old.
Manhattan, New York (2 miles away).
I click her profile.
I move past it and click her photo.
I open the message.
Wendy Mae G.

(2:05 a.m.): how was i supposed 2 kno that?
(2:05 a.m.): It’s in my profile.
Wendy Mae G.
(2:05 a.m.): fine, watevr.
do u have an open house then?
Kevin and Kelly.
21 years old.
Bronx, New York (4 miles away).
Subject: My condolences, Mateo (great name) Philly Buiser.
24 years old.
Manhattan, New York (3 miles away).
Subject: u selling a couch?
26 years old.
Manhattan, New York (1 mile away).
Subject: Dying sucks, huh?
20 years old.
Manhattan, New York (3 miles away).
I ignore Kevin and Kelly’s message; not interested in pot.
I delete J.
I’m going to answer Philly’s message—because it came first.
(2:06 a.m.): Hey, Mateo.
How’s it going?
(2:08 a.m.): Hey, Philly.
Is it too lame to say I’m hanging in there?
(2:08 a.m.): Nah, I’m sure it’s rough.
Not looking forward to the day Death-Cast calls me.
Are you sick or something?
Pretty young to be dying.
(2:09 a.m.): I’m healthy, yeah.
(2:09 a.m.): I can help with that, Mateo.
(2:09 a.m.): Help with what?
(2:09 a.m.): Making sure you don’t die.
(2:09 a.m.): That’s not a thing anyone can promise.
(2:10 a.m.): I can.
I block Philly and open up Elle’s message.
Maybe the third time will be the charm.
RUFUS 2:21 a.m.
“Look at him, Rufus.
“Not feeling so brave now, right?” Peck asks.
Aimee drags me into the living room by my wrist.
.” “What?” “There’s no point lying.
“Look, Ames, I was freaking out.
“We didn’t make sense anymore.
Sorry.” I back up.
“Nah, you good.” “We should do the funeral,” Tagoe says.
“But take your time.
It’s your day.
“I’m gonna get everyone in here.” He steps.
“I don’t want to hog you,” Aimee says.
She doesn’t let me go, not until everyone comes in.
I needed that hug.
I stay seated in the center of the couch.
I’m battling my lungs for my next breath, hard-core.
Peck keeps his distance, playing around on Aimee’s phone.
The others .
“They all cried, but your eyes were so sad, Rufus.
He’s not talking about tonight, I know that.
Francis keeps staring but doesn’t say anything else.
“We don’t have all day.” He waves Malcolm over.
“You were—you are our bro, Roof.
This is bullshit.
“They should take me instead.” “Don’t say that.
Seriously, shut up.” “I’m serious,” he says.
You matter more than other people.
Not saying sorry either.
“I’m dying and we can’t trade lives.
“Roof, I’ll miss you shutting us up like this.
There’s another cliché for you, whatever.
I want to wake up.
There’s only one person who isn’t surprised or freaking out.
“You didn’t,” Aimee says, charging toward him.
She snatches her phone from him.
“He assaulted me!” Peck shouts.
“Go out the back,” Tagoe says, twitches running wild.
Jenn Lori points at the kitchen.
I don’t know where I’m going, but I keep going.
MATEO 2:52 a.m.
The third time was not the charm.
Cove’s got it good.
I won’t be able to respawn later.
I’m wasting away in here and .
There are two bookcases in my room.
I tear down a map from the wall.
It’s chaos in here.
I have to make a move.
RUFUS 2:59 a.m.
Wish Death-Cast called before I ruined my life tonight.
I hear police sirens and keep pedaling.
I hope something else is happening.
Shit, I’m the bad guy.
I can’t keep moving, though.
I sit on the curb outside the gas station.
It smells like piss and cheap beer.
In orange spray paint it says: The Last Friend App.
I keep getting dicked out of proper goodbyes.
The loyalty Malcolm showed me time and time again.
I can’t go back now.
Maybe I shouldn’t have run.
I gotta make this up to the Plutos.
They spoke nothing but truth during their eulogies.
I’ve messed up a bit lately, but I’m good.
I really don’t wanna be alone.
I stare at the Last Friend silhouettes on the wall.
I enter the app store and I download Last Friend.
MATEO 3:14 a.m.
This diminishes the online numbers significantly.
I click on his profile.
Name: Rufus Emeterio Age: 17.
Weight: 169 lbs.
Job: Professional Time Waster.
Bucket List: Do it up.
Final Thoughts: It’s about time.
I’ve made mistakes, but I’m gonna go out right.
Maybe he’s suicidal.
I’m going to reach out.
There’s nothing risky about hello.
(3:17 a.m.): sorry you’ll be lost, Rufus.
I’m not used to reaching out to strangers like this.
(3:19 a.m.): Hey, Mateo.
He’s already connecting to the person I want to become.
(3:19 a.m.): Thanks.
Think I’m going to leave the hat here at home.
I don’t want the attention.
(3:19 a.m.): Good call.
A Luigi hat isn’t exactly a baseball cap, right?
(3:19 a.m.): Exactly.
(3:20 a.m.): Wait.
You haven’t left your house yet?
(3:20 a.m.): Nope.
(3:20 a.m.): Death-Cast called me a little after midnight.
(3:20 a.m.): What have you been doing all night?
(3:20 a.m.): Cleaning and playing video games.
(3:20 a.m.): Which game?
(3:21 a.m.): N/m the game doesn’t matter.
Don’t you have stuff you wanna do?
What are you waiting for?
not great, is the kindest way to put it.
(3:22 a.m.): I asked you first.
(3:22 a.m.): Fair.
(3:23 a.m.): I spoke to that dick too!
Not his dick, exactly.
But I reported and blocked him afterward.
I promise I’m better than that guy.
I guess that’s not saying much.
Do you wanna video-chat?
I’ll send you the invite.
An icon of a silhouette speaking into a phone flashes.
“You see me?” “Yeah, hey.
I’m Mateo.” “Hey, Mateo.
I wonder why he’s so sweaty.
“Unless that’s too personal.” “Nah, don’t worry about that.
I don’t think ‘too personal’ should exist between Last Friends.
But not doing anything is hardly comforting, either.
I can do it.” “Can you?
There’s the whole you-not-leaving-your-house problem.
“Believe me, I know it can get ugly out here.
I’m not leaving the safety of my apartment that easily.
“And I would’ve been game with game over.
You gotta go for it.” Go for it.
That’s what I said in my profile.
“Okay,” I say.
“How do we do this?
Where we should we meet?
“I’m gonna find a different Last Friend.” “It’s really not!
I swear.” I almost drop the phone.
I’ve screwed everything up.
“Seriously, I—” “I’m kidding, dude,” he says.
Except this time it’s okay to fully relax—I think.
“Will do,” I say.
“See you in a bit, Mateo.
“Be safe, Rufus.” Rufus nods and ends the video chat.
It doesn’t matter how many times we look both ways.
Shedd ANDREA DONAHUE 3:30 a.m.
Rule number one of one: Deckers are no longer people.
Andrea knows there’s nothing she can do for these Deckers.
She won’t waste her breath praying for them.
She simply tells them they’re dying and moves on.
She doesn’t just tell people they’re dying.
She gives them a chance to really live.
But she can’t live for them.
That’s on them.
She’s already done her part, and she does it well.
RUFUS 3:31 a.m.
I’m biking toward that Mateo kid’s house.
Nah, he’s chill.
If not, we can always part ways.
It makes me feel a little better, at least.
MALCOLM ANTHONY 3:34 a.m.
“They’re not gonna find Rufus.
This is assuming Rufus is still alive.
But they’ll have their lives.
MATEO 3:42 a.m.
“It’s Rufus,” he says from the other side.
He nods at me.
But the hallway is empty and now Rufus is smiling.
“I’m on your turf, dude,” Rufus says.
“If anyone should be suspicious, it’s me.
“I’m sorry, I’m just .
His palm is sweaty.
“You ready to bounce?
This is a trick question, obviously.” “I’m ready-ish,” I answer.
I lock up.
I don’t feel uneasy, but I am guarded.
And that he’s also dying today.
“Whoa, we’re not taking the elevator,” Rufus says.
The elevator is risky.
We get stuck.
We get downstairs safely.
My hand hovers over the lobby door.
I can’t do it.
It’s a nice second away from reality.
“Go ahead,” Rufus says.
I don’t want to disappoint either of us, especially myself.
But being out here now is different.
There are lights on in my neighbors’ apartments.
Rufus claps, snapping me out of my trance.
“Bucket lists are pointless.
You’re not gonna get everything done.
I know it before Rufus shakes his head.
“Yeah, well,” Rufus says.
I just .
“This isn’t going to work.
It’s going to backfire on us.
Like a Decker hot zone.
“No point fearing it.” “Not that easy.
We’re not dying from natural causes.
I’m driving him crazy.
Don’t do your last day wrong.” Rufus is right.
I know he’s right.
No more arguing.
“We can do that,” Rufus says.
“I have nothing I’m gunning to do.
“What happened?” I say.
“Nonsense.” Rufus doesn’t elaborate.
But maybe that warning wouldn’t have mattered.
Rufus sees the bird too.
“Say what?” “I don’t have this dead-is-dead-so-just-walk-away attitude,” I say.
I need to check myself.
Again.” I quit my hunt.
“Here’s the thing.
The way its eyes darted around for help.
The bird dared to leave home, at least.
“What happened then?” “I have no idea,” I admit.
“Let me find you something for the bird,” he says.
Rufus appears beside me on his bike, pedaling slowly.
“It’s a couple minutes after four,” Rufus informs me.
I know many people won’t agree or understand this sentiment.
But birds do all of this too.
Other birds are living until their time is up.
“Sorry,” Rufus says.
Yo, Mateo is too good.
But I’m mad shocked to meet someone so .
If lost, please return to the De Laineys.
Sammy Lou takes pride in that record.
He should be used to being alone by now.
He can’t get caught.
He’s been breaking into houses for a year now.
He can’t get caught.
There’s always another way.
He slips around the house, undone shoelaces slapping his ankles.
He’s sore enough as is, thanks.
He’s a year off for his age.
Things this family is good at: locking their house.
Things they suck at: stacking wood into a sturdy pile.
The lock picks go flying into the darkness.
At least there’s not far to fall.
At least the woodpile doesn’t tip over too.
‘Dammit, Avery,’ Sam says.
I was joking.
Interruptions and complications and — Avery.
‘You’re OK?’ ‘What?’ Avery blinks, confused.
How shaky his hands suddenly are.
It’s just that rush of panic for nothing.
‘I’m about to be mad.’ Sam’s teeth clench.
Sam’s lost his night vision now.
He’s not caught.
‘That would fix everything.’ Of course it would, Avery.
His fingers curl into fists.
Sticky with blood.
It’s all bluff anyway, because he’d never hit Avery.
In fact, it’s the opposite.
Avery wilts, shoulders hunched to make himself a smaller target.
Sam is stupid, stupid.
He shouldn’t have said that.
‘Why didn’t you hear me coming?’ Avery says.
We.’ Sam opens his mouth to argue, but why bother?
Sam’s never said no to him in his life.
Plus he’s not wrong about how loud they’re being.
Sam’s truly lost it this evening.
Not that it’s an untrue feeling.
Not when he has blood on his knuckles.
He suddenly feels very tired.
It’s just this.
All of it.
And don’t – don’t break anything.
I want to stay here for a few days.
Sam smothers his annoyance.
He keeps them for emergencies.
His fingers shake.
‘Are you screwing up?’ Avery says in a conversational tone.
Sam stabs harder at the lock.
But a night alone would be a quiet break.
This is your brother.
You don’t need a break.
You shouldn’t want one.
‘I just missed you,’ Avery says.
‘Sure,’ Sam says, knowing Avery won’t notice the sarcasm.
They let him sleep on their broken sofa.
And that sameness?
Only having to rotate between two places that don’t change?
That’s why Sam’s bloody and bruised tonight, isn’t it?
Fixing things for Avery.
So, simple: he doesn’t get to know.
How much it scares him.
Avery chews his lip.
Now to wash off the blood.
Now to curl up in a soft chair.
Now to be still.
Except Avery is here and Avery is never still.
Sam flies across the room and slaps the switch off.
‘Close the blinds.
Avery really is ruining it.
Where he can breathe.
An invisible boy living in an empty house.
Avery is anything but invisible.
Avery pets it excitedly.
Sam says no way in hell.
When they’ll come back.
He finds a flight itinerary in the rubbish.
He could have a week in this house.
But just to be sure, he checks: pet food dishes?
Evidence of a house sitter?
Food in the fridge?
The house is his.
His shoulders relax a fraction.
He didn’t always rob the houses.
Eat the food.
Pretended he could keep this.
Then he started taking keys.
To remember each house by.
Then he started taking money.
Hidden credit cards.
Except tonight, apparently.
What did you do now, Avery?
Sam just fixed Avery’s last screw-up.
He’s not ready for another.
They’re his) but Avery appears from behind the pantry door.
‘What the hell,’ he says, ‘are seaweed crackers?’ Sam sighs.
‘These are diseased.
Anyway, I want to—’ He looks up.
‘Leave it.’ His voice stays low.
Avery doesn’t notice Sam’s tone, he hardly ever does.
His legs swing, pace growing frantic.
Those are the rules.’ Crackers crunch.
Heels drum on the bench.
‘I guess we both broke the rules,’ Sam says quietly.
Avery’s eyes widen.
‘But I—’ ‘Save it.
Avery snaps his fingers by his ears and doesn’t answer.
This is all so unfair.
He’d need him.
Avery would have a chance to redeem himself.
The guy was big, but Sam’s good at fighting.
It scares Avery, the way Sam hits.
It scares Sam too.
But what’s he supposed to do?
He’s got nothing else.
‘In a stolen car?
Are you insane?’ ‘We’d ditch it tomorrow.
I know cars.
‘Our plan sucks.’ Avery rocks on the bench.
Let’s just drive away.
Doesn’t he know Sam at all?
Sam looks down at his hands, fisted and trembling.
And you’re a wanted criminal.
We’re going to live in our own house.
We’re going to be OK.
‘No.’ But there are too many cracks in Sam’s voice.
How unrealistic his wishes are.
How naive he’s being.
Avery’s voice grows shrill.
‘But if we stay the police will catch you!
I can’t let them catch you.
It splinters against the tiles like a gunshot.
Someone’s going to hear.
This is Avery.
‘I’ll steal a car and drive away by myself.
You c-can get caught if you want.
I don’t care.
‘Don’t say that.’ Sam’s voice is barely a whisper.
‘I’ll leave you.’ Don’t ever, ever say that.
He slams the door on his way out.
Sam doesn’t understand.
But he can’t stay here now.
He should run after Avery.
He didn’t mean it, right?
They’re all each other has.
Avery’s the only who sees Sammy Lou, the forgotten boy.
I’ll leave you.
Sam doesn’t take anything on his way out.
That’s his secret failure.
He doesn’t break into houses because he enjoys stealing.
No, let’s have a winter rerun.
Won’t that be fun?
It keeps most of the rain off.
Avery will go back to his shifty friends’ house.
No, no he will.
It was a stupid threat.
He could never just go.
It’ll be a nice day – Saturday, right?
At least that’s what he pretends normal people do.
His thoughts spin, dizzying.
He feels genuinely ill right now.
His nose won’t stop running.
She might be in a good mood.
Or she’ll call the police.
Who is he kidding?
This is Aunt Karen.
If she sees him, she’ll go straight to the phone.
Stealing houses is an art.
He needs to get off the streets and lie down.
He tries two houses.
The second house is definitely a victim of longer-term abandonment.
He can’t risk staying here.
He could find a payphone and call Avery.
At least his clothes dry in the warm midday sun.
Wow, he’s so healthy.
Sam checks the street.
He listens at the doors but it’s silent.
Please be empty, please please please.
It’s an open-plan room, with support poles instead of walls.
Check for fresh food?
Still … that’s promising.
Another sign that the occupants are away.
Back on Sunday.
The house is his.
Take that, you freaking streaming nose.
Sam’s favourite type of house.
By the way, Sam, you are a freak.
He feels feverishly warm.
OK, so these people don’t believe in cupboards.
They believe in obstacle courses.
He has a new appreciation for only having one brother.
Imagine a dozen Averys?
No thank you.
He is so very, very tired.
Side effects probably … definitely … include … drowsiness.
The sun is so warm on his cheek.
But if Sammy complains he’ll just get another slap.
Avery hums softly to himself in the seat beside Sammy.
He knows Avery’s just sharing, but Sammy’s hungry.
Then he goes still.
Scared of a slap.
Scared, even more, that Avery will get it.
He should’ve stayed quiet.
People stream out and in, wearing silly dresses.
They must be cold.
He reaches back and snatches the toy off Avery.
Avery gives a surprised yelp.
A sick hole gnaws at Sam’s stomach.
‘Grow up, Avery,’ their dad snaps.
His voice is a warning growl.
‘I’ll be a few minutes.
Sit here while I pick something up.
Sammy glances sideways at Avery.
He needs his car.
It’s his special car.
He always has it.
Fix this, Sammy.
‘He’ll give it back,’ says Sammy.
‘Just be good.
Just wait.’ Please please please.
His dad has been angry ever since.
Well, he’s always angry.
This is not good.
He can’t move.
He hates loud things.
Why’s he going in there?
He doesn’t need his car that much, does he?
He sits there, handfuls of wild butterflies in his belly.
Avery never figures anything out.
But maybe it’ll be OK?
Are they all laughing?
You have to hold him.
You have to take him away till he calms down.
Even Sammy knows this and he’s only seven.
Hard to do because Avery writhes and kicks.
Sammy holds his breath.
It’ll fix everything.
It doesn’t matter if Avery’s too old.
It makes him feel better.
And he hits him.
Avery’s screams turn to sobs.
Sammy fights with his seatbelt now.
No one to hear over the thunder of the club.
Sammy’s beaten his knuckles bloody on the window.
Sammy can’t breathe.
He is red fire and he is burning.
You’re not allowed to hit Avery like that.
You’re not allowed.
He stretches shivering fingers to his brother.
His brother who is finally still and quiet.
He’s being good.
He wriggles free and crawls across the seat to Avery.
But his eyes find the rearview mirror and meet Sammy’s.
His dad’s eyes are furious.
Sammy hates him.
Sammy, strong and fierce, crouches over his brother.
‘It’s OK,’ Sammy whispers.
Sammy’s voice is trembly but fierce.
‘I’ll kill them.’ Deep in the house, Avery is shouting.
But he hasn’t slept this well in a long time.
Probably because he drugged himself.
Sam frowns in his sleep.
He’s in an empty house.
That’s not … empty.
He’s in a house that’s not empty.
He’s not even sure what time it is.
Did he sleep all night?
He scrabbles off the armchair and over to the desk.
Sam’s slept for a whole day.
This can’t be happening.
Not hearing Avery sneak up on him is one thing.
But sleeping through a family returning?
He’s losing his touch.
He’s losing his mind.
They haven’t come in here yet, so that’s good.
Nothing is good.
He’s in a house full of people.
He can’t get out.
‘DAD!’ a girl’s voice hollers right outside the office door.
‘Which one?’ someone else yells, softer and distant.
Hands scrabbling for a phone.
He has to hide.
Then the door opens and he forgets how to breathe.
A girl storms in.
Sam’s knees are at his throat.
His heart punches new bruises into his ribs.
You’re such an idiot, Sammy Lou.
Sam stuffs knuckles into his mouth and bites.
Just hold on, just wait.
And, pathetically, it’s special to him.
It’s the only thing he owns.
‘Ugh, Jack,’ she mutters, and steps over it.
She steps over it!
Sam remembers oxygen.
And in this mess, that’s probably likely.
Whoever ‘Jack’ is, he can happily take the blame.
Sam is fine with that.
Please don’t come back.
After a few deep gulps, he crawls out.
He grabs his backpack and opens the door a crack.
The hall is empty.
Unfortunately downstairs has no walls to hide behind.
When did he get so careless?
Don’t put it off.
He slips out of the warm office, his false safety.
He’s doing this.
The damage is immense.
There truly are half a million people down there.
A baby cries.
A plate breaks.
Someone yells for them to turn it down.
No, turn it off.
No, get ready for lunch.
Get the baby.
Wash your hands.
Stop eating all the corn chips.
Faces light up.
They are all hopelessly consumed with each other.
Drunk on people and noise and food.
Sam can do this.
Isn’t that his entire life?
Sam moves for the stairs, hand on the rail.
Blood pulses in his ears.
Do not look at her at all.
His eyebrows are angry forests.
‘Dude, I don’t even recognise you,’ he says.
Don’t you know how Sundays work?
The exit is officially an ocean away.
They could all see him if only they looked up.
They’re shooed along by another boy.
But the boy beats him to it.
But – oh wait.
He stole a shirt.
It’s probably unique.
It’s probably special.
He didn’t mean to be here.
‘Jeremy’s friend?’ The boy sighs.
Did he even tell you how Sundays work?
‘You look shell-shocked.
Hit him and run.
He nearly does.
Then he’s gone.
Sam might be having a panic attack.
Oh, you must be one of Jeremy’s friends, right?
And he’s nodding.
What is he supposed to do?
Just a little.
Well, what the hell, right?
He’s officially taken house burglary to the next level.
He’s stealing families and their Sunday lunches.
Faces blur together.
He’s totally fine with that.
But he won’t press his luck.
His pulse stutters.
Well, he knew he’d get caught, didn’t he?
He deserves the shriek of intruder.
Except it doesn’t come.
‘I was just leaving—’ Sam says.
‘Kitchen.’ She claps her hands together briskly.
Dishwasher is already full.
After all, he did eat their food.
This entire day is doing his head in.
Plates keep coming.
He wipes his sodden hands on his shirt.
He takes one.
‘Take two,’ says the man.
Did they leave you with the dishes?
They’re now playing cricket on the street.
‘I’ll leave the plate here.
He’s so pathetic, right?
That he’d lap this up.
The girl still looks at Sam.
‘So,’ says the girl.
She’s going to talk to him?
You’re kind of small compared to Jeremy’s usual strays.
‘I don’t trust you.’ Sam’s throat is dry.
‘Well, I don’t trust whoever killed this pot.
‘That was me.’ Oh.
He notices there’s handsewn embroidery all over the skirt.
So she’s the seamstress.
‘Well,’ Moxie says, ‘it sucked.
‘How was your trip?’ Moxie says.
‘The camping trip you boys all went on?
You all need to shower, by the way.
For hours.’ Sam can play along, right?
He’s got this.
‘Oh, well … it was great.
Good, um, weather.’ What do you even say about camping?
He’s never been camping.
‘Chatty, aren’t you?’ Moxie licks brownie off her thumb.
Why is he still talking?
‘Excuse you,’ Moxie says.
‘Speaking of being disagreeable,’ she says.
‘Why hasn’t Jeremy come to rescue you anyway?
Technically now I’m yours.
‘Hey, we’re going to the beach,’ a boy tells Moxie.
‘Hi,’ he says.
‘Are you Moxie’s friend?
She doesn’t usually invite people over.’ He smiles.
‘I’m Jeremy.’ No, I’m supposed to be your friend.
‘Ah, yeah, Moxie’s friend,’ Sam says.
Get out of there, man.
We’re going to the beach.
He’s not going to the beach with them.
Because why not.
Just don’t ask me who I am.
Jeremy reappears, eating leftover potato salad with a soup ladle.
‘Ready?’ he says to no one in particular.
Is Moxie back yet?
What’s she doing up there?’ He raises his voice.
‘How long does it take to put swimmers on, Moxie!
‘Girls,’ he says.
Jack yelps and grabs his side like he’s been shot.
The hordes pour towards the door.
And Moxie is nearly a head shorter than everyone else.
He wonders if she’s his age.
He wants this.
He absolutely can’t have it.
She catches his eye and he looks away.
‘Coming, dishwasher boy?’ It’s because they don’t know him.
He’s absolutely mad, of course, to follow them.
How could you?
They don’t know him.
Why the police want him.
Why his aunt won’t even look at him.
And it feels good.
She glances sideways at Sam.
‘Are you swimming in jeans?
She bats it off and glares.
‘Eh, just swim in your boxers,’ Jeremy says lightly.
He jerks the hem down quickly.
She purses her lips together, like she’ll ask.
Please don’t ask.
It’s deep enough.
We threw Jack in headfirst to test it once.
No broken neck.’ ‘Pity,’ mutters Moxie.
‘And definitely don’t do anything Jack wouldn’t do.
Actually, don’t do anything Jack would do.
Sam finds himself looking anywhere but at her indigo bikini.
And then realises how conspicuous that is.
And then realises he’s blushing.
And then decides he needs to go drown.
Moxie never so much walks as marches with angry intensity.
Jeremy pats Sam on the shoulder.
‘You look nervous.
The water seems deep.
The rocks are hot.
Jack ignores her, eyes lighting on Sam.
Sam’s heart still crawls into his mouth.
He looks away.
He can’t imagine Avery enjoying this day.
He tries, but he just can’t.
‘Hey!’ someone says, a note of panic in their voice.
Does it matter?
And the sea hits him.
It’s shockingly cool.
Then his head splits the surface.
Where was the part where he stayed low profile?
Something like anger.
Jeremy treads water and then splashes water into Sam’s face.
‘Maniac.’ But he’s smiling.
‘It’s not hard.’ ‘Oi!
‘Sam?’ But he says it like a question.
‘Well, get up here.
Jeremy dodges and gets a mouthful of ocean.
He goes under garbling.
‘Get up here, kid.
I’m keeping you.
Underwater, no one but the ocean sees him smile.
Sammy is seven and maybe Avery is dead.
They drove all night.
Please please please.
The car pulls into a driveway, the engine rattles off.
Sammy, now with Avery’s head in his lap, goes stiff.
Then he hammers the front door.
Karen, open up.’ A dog across the street barks.
A slow car rumbles past.
Avery shifts in his arms.
There’s something wrong with Avery’s eyes.
They’re dull and broken and hollow.
He drags Avery out.
Avery doesn’t even whimper.
‘Be on your best behaviour.’ His voice is raw.
Her lips are a line.
Her brow furrows.
‘What’s going on, Clay?’ she snaps.
‘I just told you, Jen isn’t here.
His aunt stares.
‘I haven’t seen you kids in four years.
No, six.’ ‘I’m Sammy,’ he whispers.
He doesn’t remember her.
Like, in his head, their dad hasn’t stopped hitting him.
Then his dad yells.
Then Aunt Karen yells.
Sammy wants to cover Avery’s ears.
His whole trembling body.
Someone has to protect him.
But he can do this.
Then he turns on his boys, eyes molten pools.
Sammy’s chest tightens.
But his dad just holds out the toy car.
Sammy’s chest tightens, a fist on his lungs.
Then he snatches the car.
‘Because that’s where it ends, Sammy boy.
He wouldn’t give them to his dad anyway.
Aunt Karen comes back inside, rewrapping her tulip dressing gown.
‘Is he coming back soon?’ Sam says.
Aunt Karen closes her eyes.
‘You’re staying with me for a while.
Aunt Karen sighs and reaches for Avery.
‘Avery,’ she snaps.
‘Let me help.
To stand on top of the wicker chair and scream.
His eyes are burned out blue.
‘Don’t take his—’ Sammy says, but it’s too late.
Avery starts screaming.
And he just doesn’t stop.
Sam hesitates on the stairs.
‘You might as well stay for dinner,’ she says.
‘Sunday night is waffles.’ Sam stays.
The house has emptied considerably.
Moxie’s dad waves from the kitchen.
Hopefully that’s a joke.
‘How many are staying, Jeremy?’ he says.
‘We’re teenage boys.’ Jeremy smacks him playfully on the head.
‘Only six of us guys left.
Thanks for remembering me.
Don’t forget Jack’s new adopted hatchling Sam.’ Sam shrinks.
He can’t help it.
‘Did you swim in your clothes?
Their father wisely makes more waffles.
‘Dude, don’t you ever eat?
Please consume at least nineteen waffles tonight.
‘He could wear a towel?’ Sam feels a little panicky.
Then she notices.
‘What?’ She looks at them and then at Sam.
No.’ ‘Come on, he’s your height,’ Jeremy says.
‘I’ll clean his clothes super fast.
He looks up to three concerned faces.
‘Look, he’s gone and caught cold,’ Jeremy says reproachfully.
‘I had the flu already,’ Sam says.
It’s nothing.’ The father turns back to the griddle.
‘Wet clothes aren’t helping.
Moxie …’ He casts her a meaningful look.
Moxie throws her hands in the air.
‘Oh, fine.’ She stabs a finger at him.
Or would he be?
He’s not exactly a stranger any more.
He showed Jack how to do a backflip.
Someone tipped sand down his shirt.
He’s eaten their potato salad and worn their clothes.
The trouble is he stole it all, every moment.
And that’s the part people don’t overlook.
They feel betrayed.
Betrayed people have the hardest fists.
This whole family is really forceful.
‘But these are girls’ jeans …’ Sam starts.
Moxie abruptly releases him and narrows her eyes.
‘If they don’t fit, then we’ll discuss,’ Moxie says.
‘But they’re big on me anyway.
Towels under the sink.
‘Jeremy,’ she clarifies.
‘Jeremy does laundry.
Jack does yard work.
Grady is supposed to houseclean, but he whinges about allergies.
I look after the babies way too much.
‘That bruise looked pretty vicious.
What happened?’ Lies run through Sam’s head.
None tumble out of his mouth.
‘Hmm,’ Moxie says.
He gets a real hot shower.
With real soap.
He feels like Moxie chose it on purpose.
The tone downstairs is as worn out as he feels.
Then she slides it back to him.
‘The De Lainey special.
The rest of the little kids were my Uncle Robin’s.
‘Six hellion cousins there.
Maybe she won’t think too hard about it?
‘No, Grady’s the oldest,’ Moxie says.
Jeremy and Jack are next.
‘I heard that,’ Dash says.
Moxie rolls her eyes.
So he’s left to slide a tentative question at her.
Not that he has any right to ask.
Not that he should be drawing attention to himself.
‘And you?’ Moxie says.
Grady uses a spoon as a bookmark and looks up.
Sam should leave before Moxie asks more questions.
Sam feels sick around adults.
But there are still waffles left and … well, waffles.
‘Wishful,’ their father says, ‘but no.
Absolutely not, Dad.’ ‘I’ll take the weekends,’ their father says.
Except that he is.
Her father’s voice stays unfailingly mild.
‘Sweetie, I’m not trying to make it that way.
Mr De Lainey builds houses?
His heart beats a little faster.
‘Right, so we’re sorted?’ Jack says.
Gotcha.’ Their father’s lips thin.
And we talked about this.
And there are …’ His voice thickens.
Grady immediately gathers plates and mumbles something about loving building.
‘You can knock off at three,’ his dad says.
‘Moxie.’ Their father gently nudges her shoulder.
‘Murmph.’ ‘Look, it’s just the babies.
‘We’re going to make a film!
‘And I was going to work on my design portfolio.
I’m alone and broken.’ Her father starts clearing up plates.
‘You can still sew.
I’ll take over as soon as I get home.
And when school starts, we’ll get the babies in daycare.
This deadline is a beast.’ ‘Fine.
‘I’m sure your folks aren’t spoiling your summer plans, eh?
The lights flick off.
Moxie flops on the sofa next to Sam.
It was the only available seat, he tells himself.
That’s why she sat next to him.
All at once.
Even though the movie seriously freaks him out.
There’s plenty of air.
But his lungs don’t quite work any more.
Stop twitching your fingers.
Like they’re seeing him, really seeing him.
Sam opens his mouth – to defend himself?
‘Did you see his face?
‘How is his hearing so good?’ Jeremy pats his shoulder.
‘Only for you and your swearing, buddy.
His face is so hot, his clothes so tight.
Sam wants to bury himself.
‘You nearly pissed yourself,’ Jack says.
Jeremy hits him.
Moxie is still laughing silently, a hand over her mouth.
‘I’m sorry.’ Her voice is soft as sand and sea.
‘I shouldn’t have laughed.
Pathetic, pathetic Sam.
‘There’s still part two,’ Jack says.
Sam might be sick.
‘It’s past eleven.’ Moxie licks popcorn salt off her thumb.
This is the part where Sam slips away.
He’ll never have this again.
He has to leave.
Friends that Sam’s supposed to be leaving with.
Sam looks at the stairs.
He wouldn’t dare.
His eyes rest on Sam.
‘Thanks for coming, Sam,’ says Mr De Lainey.
He remembers Sam’s name?
‘See you again soon, son.
You wouldn’t dare— Sam’s throat is tight.
He reaches for the kettle and a mug.
Sam bolts for the stairs.
No one will notice if he doesn’t come back downstairs.
No one will go into that office this late.
He’ll leave tomorrow.
One last night that feels strangely like … home.
Sammy is eight and it’s war at the kitchen table.
He gets overwhelmed and cries.
He gets that way about a lot of things.
He’s getting too much for Aunt Karen to pin down.
That’s why she’s on the phone.
‘—complete rubbish, Clay.
The phone call, however, he understands just fine.
I do not want these goddamn boys.
A forever scar.
Their aunt gives a frustrated shout and then goes silent.
She strides into the kitchen, all hard edges and splinters.
His ear still smarts from being caught and slapped too.
Sammy’s legs freeze, mid-swing, shoelaces making a final clack.
Like Avery is trying to be difficult.
Frantic fluttering crawls up Sammy’s throat.
That can’t happen.
He’s Avery’s protector, his everything.
He’s not listening.
Sammy’s words come choked.
‘But, please, you c-can’t.
‘Fine.’ She stomps to the kitchen.
He loves those.
It hurts him.
Sammy could tell her this if she listened.
If anyone listened.
But he is the invisible boy and no one cares.
Avery’s eyes widen.
Aunt Karen spins on Sammy.
‘Stay out there like animals then!’ The door slams.
The lock clicks.
They’re used to this, but it’s cold tonight.
Avery’s hands flutter.
‘I c-c-can’t—’ ‘I know.’ Sammy pets his arm.
‘Just let me think.
‘I could steal some tools.’ Excitement flickers in his voice.
‘I could steal some biscuits too.
His eyes are just sad.
‘Can you do that?’ Avery whispers.
‘Steal houses?’ ‘Yeah,’ Sammy says.
It sounds very traumatic.
The two little kids are tag-team crying.
Jack and Moxie lock in a shouting match.
No one can find car keys.
Dash says she’s leaving home.
Goodbyes are hollered.
The front door slams.
Engines fade down the road.
He picks up.
Puts it back.
He’s obviously saving this for worst-case scenarios.
But Sam is a thief.
This is what he does, isn’t it?
He pokes his head out the door.
The house is suddenly quiet.
Sam slips across the hall and peeks through the stairwell.
A De Laineyflavoured explosion has hit.
‘Quit it, Toby,’ she orders.
‘You’re having a bath.
Water turns on.
Toby howls like he’s being murdered.
The baby toddles after them, cradling a pot of jam.
Sam’s getaway path is clear.
Except he doesn’t want to get away.
But he can’t stay.
And also because Avery might be gone.
Where else can Sam go?
He looks like trouble.
The De Lainey cash just slips through his fingers.
This is his life.
Steal and spend and stay alive.
Sam usually comes in the back, but not today.
Which is why, distracted, he walks straight into the boss.
‘Sammy Lou.’ He has a voice like old engines.
He’s still here.
‘Sorry,’ Sam says.
‘You know what’s breaking around here?
My mind on why I kept that kid on.
He’s practised this look for maximum patheticness.
‘I’m really sorry for distracting him.
‘Just don’t distract him.
So Avery got his second chance.
His bare arms are stick thin and smeared with grease.
Is that about their fight?
‘You stayed,’ Sam says.
‘What?’ Avery pauses, arms half lost in the engine.
‘What are you talking about?’ ‘The other night?
Avery’s eyes narrow.
‘That was just talk.
Does my boss know you’re here?
So Avery knows what Sam did.
Oh, he definitely knows.
And this is all Avery’s fault anyway, right?
You need this job.’ ‘That was an accident.
Sam bites back his pained whimper.
Avery’s voice rises.
‘You meant to break someone’s hand.
I hate it.
Agonising heat flushes Sam’s cheeks.
He wants to shove him back, but he can’t.
He’d never touch Avery to hurt him.
‘You need this job.’ Sam’s voice is low.
But his breathing evens out.
Shut up about it.’ Avery’s teeth clench.
‘I mean it.
It drives Sam mad, because Avery is good with engines.
But he has to stay calm.
Not get overwhelmed.
Not let anyone see him freak out.
The police must not find the Lou brothers.
After what Sam did at school last year?
Sam wants to shout: Look, Avery!
This is exactly why you can’t be alone!
Who’d calm you down if I wasn’t here?
This is what brothers do.
He fiddles with a loose thread on his jeans.
He can’t believe he forgot to change.
He’ll add it to their savings.
‘Can we not fight?’ Sam whispers.
‘S-stop hurting people.
‘Then stop screwing up,’ Sam says.
No one looks twice.
They’re here to work.
He clearly doesn’t trust Avery alone in the workshop.
Which ends up with the Lou brothers analysing tourist targets.
Someone happy or affectionate.
Someone who’ll care.
Avery gives him a sour look.
He could use a bath.
Sam still has on the smiley-face shirt and Moxie’s jeans.
Does she wonder about him?
Why’s he even thinking that?
Sam rubs the back of his sweaty neck.
‘Well, we can’t do the one where you fake-vomit.
‘I’m hitting, you’re running.’ Sam gives him a flat look.
Obviously that’s how they divide the parts.
He can’t even fake hitting Avery.
‘Stop calling them “jobs”.
What do think this is?
Like it’s sliding.
He wants to catch it before someone falls.
He puts it in the bin.
Avery stands, anticipation in his jittering arms.
Their handbag isn’t quite zipped.
Sam’s hand is in and out before he stands up.
Right on the bruise.
Sam’s wince is real.
‘You want to run that by me again?’ Avery shouts.
Sam slaps his hand away.
‘Hey, take it easy.’ He’s not faking, though.
Avery’s a little too into it today.
‘Shut the hell up!’ Avery shoves him again.
His neck snaps to the side.
His teeth sink into his tongue.
His vision fractures.
Avery really really forgot to fake that punch.
Blood dribbles down his chin.
Someone gives a heartfelt gasp.
People back off and stare.
Voices flood over Sam.
‘I’m fine.’ The words slur without trying.
His hand darts toward a back pocket.
Someone gives a grateful cry.
‘Here comes a security guard!’ Sam’s body tenses.
They need to run now.
But she’s paused, wipes halfway to the baby’s face.
Moxie stares at him.
Sam jerks away.
Did she see his face?
She wouldn’t have.
It’s Sam’s fault.
He let himself get distracted.
They should be gone by now.
Sam doesn’t think.
Hey!’ The person lunges at him.
Sam tips two fingers in salute and then— runs.
Then he’s gone.
He never looks back to see if Sam made it.
Sam takes care of himself.
The security guard chases, shouting into his walkie-talkie.
Noise runs over his back.
Bodies shove him out the way.
He’s lost in a crowd.
The last wallet is still in his hand.
Not a bad haul.
He walks and flips through them.
The second is a fat tourist wallet.
Fifties and twenties.
Then he drops that wallet in a flowerbed.
If he can find Avery.
His fingers press gently at his jaw.
It’s not like that’s usual for him, right?
But this is Avery.
He hates hitting.
It doesn’t matter.
She’s nobody to him.
But he keeps looking.
And he sees her again.
Moxie De Lainey.
Sam wonders if she’s talking about him.
Yeah sure, Sam.
The entire world revolves around you.
She probably (definitely) didn’t recognise you.
She probably (definitely) didn’t care.
STOP.’ Sam’s fingers freeze.
His head snaps up.
Sam doesn’t even think.
Cars stream forward.
Sam’s shoes hit the road.
He twists so his back is to the oncoming car.
‘Moxie,’ Sam says.
Just a whisper.
Just a breath.
It’s all happened so fast.
No chance to think.
A horn blasts.
Undone shoelaces twist around Sam’s ankles.
He takes a breath.
The car hits.
Then the world stammers to an abrupt halt.
It doesn’t hurt.
He doesn’t care.
Car doors slam.
Voices rise in panicked flurry.
Blood, hot and thick and metallic, coats Sam’s arms.
He pushes himself up.
Let me call an ambulance—’ The driver is sobbing.
Someone has a phone out, frantically dialling.
‘No.’ Sam tastes hot bitumen, salty blood.
He scrambles to his feet.
He looks for Moxie.
Their backs are to Sam.
Their father’s shoulders shake.
But there’s not a scratch on the little boy.
Sam clutches at the car hood for a second.
‘I’m fine.’ Moxie looks up over her father’s shoulder.
Sam turns away.
He’s fine, he’s fine fine fine.
His body screams so he just runs faster.
Blood slicks down his arms.
Just get away.
Don’t let people see.
Don’t let them notice.
The footpath ends here.
He sinks into the gutter, grabbing his stomach.
The ground pulses and agony flashes in his guts.
He puts his head between his legs and vomits.
Tears spill next, hot and fat down his cheeks.
A shadow falls over his head.
‘Whoa,’ Avery says.
‘Sammy.’ His voice is high and panicked.
‘What the hell, Sammy?
You could’ve died!
Why would you even – you idiot.
You cc-could’ve died!
Sam hurts he hurts he hurts.
‘I don’t need a hospital.
Shut up, OK?
You’re lying.’ Sam glances sideways at him.
Avery’s hands spin as he crouches by Sam.
‘Avery,’ he whispers, ‘it was a little kid.
So just shut up.’ Avery grabs Sam’s shoulder.
We’ll go to my friend’s place.’ Oh, great.
‘No,’ Sam says, voice rough.
‘I don’t like them.’ ‘What?
‘She’ll call the police on us.
‘You don’t understand a single freaking thing.
His eyes go blank, guttered out.
When their dad hit him.
Avery just shuts down.
Sam has never made him do that before.
Avery rises and skitters back.
And he runs.
Anger suddenly whitens behind Sam’s eyes.
Sam shoves to his feet and limps down the street.
People stare, but he focuses ahead.
He looks over his shoulder.
Avery hasn’t come back.
Because it hurts.
That’s the only reason.
No one notices Sam.
Obviously he should go steal another house.
But he’s not staked anything out.
It could take for ever to find one.
And he hurts.
He hurts too much to pick a lock.
He hurts too much to rob a family.
He hurts too much to breathe.
That’s not an option.
He doesn’t even know them.
They don’t know him.
They wouldn’t want to know him.
Sam can’t just sneak back in.
If you count how he hits things.
He wonders if Moxie is back.
If she recognised him.
If Toby is really all right.
He can’t just go in.
Unless … Unless he says he’s Moxie’s friend.
Depends on who’s asking.
He has to come up with a story.
He … fell?
Good one, Sam.
No one will see through that.
You want to con someone?
Like they’re expecting him.
It hurts to stand straight, but he’ll do it.
The front door is already open.
He raps knuckles on the doorframe.
A hand shoots up from the sofa and waves vaguely.
‘Come in,’ says a tired voice.
‘Unless you’re an axe murderer.
Then stay out or whatever.’ ‘Wow, Jeremy.
That was convincing.
Sam steps in, muscles coiled.
‘It’s Sam.’ Jeremy’s head pops up from behind the sofa.
A soft grin spreads across his face.
Here for Moxie?’ Sam comes in a little further.
He’s committed now, isn’t he?
‘Oh, right.’ Jeremy flops back down.
He can’t see Sam at all now.
‘Moxie is out,’ Jack says.
‘Dad’s bribing her with gelato.
Favouritism.’ ‘They’ll be back soon, though,’ Jeremy adds.
Sam realises they don’t know what happened to Toby.
It’s been an hour, maybe two, and Moxie hasn’t returned.
Maybe Toby is actually hurt?
He slips towards the staircase.
His heart rabbits so fast he can scarcely think.
What the hell is he doing?
He can’t just … he can’t be doing this.
But he is.
Buckets of bath toys block the way to the sink.
He presses that to his side and nearly passes out.
When is he going to grow some freaking brains?
Like the glorious idiot he is.
The vacuum shuts off.
‘Jack!’ Grady shouts.
Clean it up.
Now.’ Jeremy’s voice drifts from downstairs, sweet and innocent.
‘Don’t be insensitive, bro.
‘I am so sick of both of you,’ Grady hollers.
Please go downstairs.
He clicks the office door shut.
And he’s alone.
It’ll end badly.
If someone bursts in here, what would he do?
Sink to his knees and cry.
The noise downstairs suddenly escalates and Sam’s shoulders tighten.
A baby shrieks.
Toby really is fine.
‘—hit by a car,’ Moxie is saying.
Voices mix and tumble.
Hit Jeremy with it.’ ‘—no, the baby’s fine.
He cracks open the office door to hear better.
And then he’ll have to run again.
Sammy is ten and he lost Avery.
This isn’t happening.
This can’t happen.
Avery isn’t waiting.
Avery is supposed to wait.
Sammy rips apart the school grounds looking.
nothing nothing nothing Don’t panic.
Maybe he walked home alone?
Sammy’s not even sure he could without getting lost.
Sammy runs the whole way, tattered backpack punching his spine.
He dumps it by their letterbox and runs inside.
‘Where’s Avery?’ he gasps.
Aunt Karen flicks her cigarette in the sink.
‘What are you talking about?
‘I don’t know where he is!
We have to go look.
‘He’s just avoiding chores, Sammy, and your dramatics are tiring.
Aunt Karen’s lips thin.
‘That’s enough attitude, young man.
He’s not a baby.
He’ll show up when he wants to.’ She doesn’t understand.
Sammy doesn’t wait.
He goes to the park, full of prickles and rubbish.
He flies across footpaths.
To the shops.
Back to school.
Back to the streets.
The air chills and smells of car exhaust and loneliness.
He runs anyway.
Sammy trails, dejected and exhausted, back to his street.
Avery could be dead.
It’s all Sammy’s fault.
His heartbeat stutters and fear pricks his skin.
There’s a glimpse of whiteblond hair.
He has energy after all.
‘I’m sorry,’ Sammy says.
‘I’m sorry, he’s s-sorry, we’re so so sorry.
He didn’t mean it.
He’s running his toy car up and down his face.
‘Hey, whoa there, little mate.
This is your brother?’ ‘I’m Sammy Lou,’ he says.
He has a split lip, but he smiles anyway.
‘We’re bringing your brother home.
Not taking him away.’ Sammy thinks he might cry.
He will not cry.
There are folded arms and frowns.
‘Come on, little mate,’ says the cop.
Digging in like a bite.
Like a barnacle.
The cop staggers in surprise, and then laughs.
Sammy hops after them, teeth chattering.
They must’ve been so, so nice to him.
Aunt Karen’s face is stony as they arrive.
The cop’s cut lip.
You can’t hit a cop.
He didn’t mean to.’ The woman gives a small smile.
‘Ah, you must be Sammy.
Avery needed him and he wasn’t there.
‘Please,’ Sammy whispers.
‘He wasn’t gone for that long.’ ‘Five hours,’ Sammy says.
His aunt shoots him a poisoned look.
The lady cop folds her arms.
And Aunt Karen has to listen.
‘Come on, kiddo, home now.
Safe and sound.’ Finally Avery lets go.
Too old for cars.
Too old to be carried.
Too old not to know his way home.
Sammy nearly smiles.
‘I’m lost,’ Avery whispers.
‘Not any more.’ Sammy casts damp eyes to the cop.
He tucks his hands behind his back.
‘No.’ The cop raises an eyebrow.
‘All right, Sammy, let’s talk seriously for a moment.
The cop nods, the lightness gone from his smile.
A lot of trouble.
You sort yourself out, hey?
It’s a lie, the nod.
The cop wouldn’t understand.
If kids hurt Avery, then what else can Sammy do?
He has to hit them.
He had to.
But he’s not like his dad.
He’d never never go too far.
The police leave.
Aunt Karen locks the door and marches into the kitchen.
‘I’ve had enough of this, Avery.
You know better.
Sammy shoves between them, all fire flares and burning blood.
Sammy matches Aunt Karen’s eyes, flint for charcoal.
Her teeth clench.
‘If you think he’ll learn from it, you’re wrong.
Sammy seals his lips tight.
He looks at Avery.
But Avery doesn’t scream for Aunt Karen to stop.
He just looks confused and scared.
No one saves Sammy.
It’s OK, right?
He’s used to it.
So long as his brother is safe.
He licks his thumb and flips the page.
He’s not been in here the entire three days, obviously.
Then he cased out a few houses.
He just hasn’t … moved … into … them yet.
Leftovers, for instance.
Jeremy’s Greek zucchini and halloumi falafel is incredible.
Moxie’s reheated spring rolls are disgusting.
The only worry that gnaws at his chest is Avery.
Always, always Avery.
He hasn’t seen him in three days.
But he’ll be with his friends.
Sam licks his thumb and flips another page.
He feels so guilty.
To bathe in?
‘TRY ME.’ A small smile tugs at Sam’s lips.
Dust lines the bookshelves.
He wonders what happened to the De Laineys’ mother.
Did she walk out too?
Sam can’t remember his mother’s face.
Leaving them with him.
Their dad and his fists and his molasses eyes.
She’s just another reason to never, never trust adults.
Sam drops the book.
But he doesn’t have time.
‘… because it’s illegal for kids to use glitter, actually.
‘I am twenty-five!’ Toby shouts.
‘Nice try,’ Moxie says and turns.
Don’t call the police yet.
I can explain.
Except he really really can’t.
Their eyes meet.
Air escapes Sam’s lungs like they’ve been punctured.
Toby stands behind her wearing a Batman mask.
‘Who’s dat?’ Moxie screams.
She hurls the ice cream tub at Sam.
The lid pops.
The air fills with a soaring, shimmering rainbow arc.
Moxie keeps screaming.
Toby joins in.
He jumps the veranda steps and his shoes hit cement.
Get out of here and don’t ever look back.
Asking himself why why why did he do this?
He didn’t want it to end like this.
It rakes his throat.
Get away from here.
He listens for sirens.
For someone to shout stop that thief.
Walk, Sammy, just keep walking.
Anywhere but here.
He doesn’t want to be here.
There are simple rules for surviving a lifestyle like his.
Number one: don’t get caught.
And he freaking blew that.
It makes him angry, all over again.
Aunt Karen’s street wasn’t much better.
And Avery’s just trotted right back in.
Because it’s familiar.
Because it’s home.
Yeah OK, the Lou brothers are still criminals.
Endless plans as they walked to and from school.
All they need is money, right?
It’s not impossible.
He stops outside a row of apartments.
Windows are barred.
Piles of junk sit in gutters.
Is this even the right number?
Does he know anyone who doesn’t want him in jail?
He needs new friends.
Or any friends.
A non-judgemental dog maybe.
‘What is my life?’ he mutters and knocks.
‘Is Avery Lou there?
I’m his brother.’ Silence.
Sam kicks the door.
‘Wow, it is you,’ Avery says.
‘I thought you hated this place.’ He pauses.
‘And me.’ Sam grits his teeth.
‘You know that’s not true.
Now can I come in?
I’m about to be arrested.’ Avery opens the door.
‘I guess that’s usual.
But I—’ He breaks off with a choke.
Sam shoves past, leaving glittering footprints.
Honestly, it wouldn’t be that hard to catch him.
Avery opens his mouth.
‘Just lend me some clothes and—’ Avery bursts out laughing.
‘It’s too much.
Avery makes a show of holding his breath.
Sam is done.
He’s just done.
And his brother is a jerk.
‘Screw you, Avery,’ Sam says.
He looks so much younger when he’s laughing.
Sam hopes he hacks up a lung.
The carpet smells like cat piss.
Sam rubs the bridge of his nose.
That’s a mistake.
A creep hiding in her house.
Hot, anxious knives carve his stomach.
‘So what happened?
‘Hilarious,’ Sam says.
Crumbs fall out of the folds.
Day off.’ But he has too many lying tells.
Like how he immediately hunches over, waiting for a blow.
‘Shower’s upstairs,’ he says, fast.
Sam sighs and follows him upstairs.
There are other closed doors, muted voices behind them.
‘Um, I don’t know?
‘Because I have friends.
What exactly is he saying?
‘But they’re all way older than you.’ They’re using you.
They’re bad news.
Are you a getaway driver?
Sammy does not have the energy for that conversation.
About what?’ Avery’s face is so open – so naive.
Sam scratches glitter behind his ear.
Just do it later.
‘About why you’re covered in glitter?’ Avery says.
‘Never mind,’ says Sam.
‘It won’t happen again.’ It will never, never happen again.
Just not glitter.
He gives up.
Why couldn’t Moxie have just slapped him?
He needed that fragile paradise.
He needed it so he could breathe again.
He hesitates over his glitter-covered clothes – De Lainey clothes.
Then he stuffs them into a garbage bag.
Forget it, Sam.
And he’s not alone.
They’re both drinking beer.
The girl looks him up and down coolly.
Once upon a time, it was little cars.
Sam tucks his hands into his jean pockets.
‘Um, hi … Vin.
‘Oh,’ Avery says, ‘you still look like roadkill.
Sam jerks his shirt back down.
That’s not why— Is it?
‘Avery,’ Sam tries again, voice quiet, ‘can we go?
Let’s—’ ‘I’ll take him over,’ Vin says.
It freaks him out, what happens when he’s not here.
Sam didn’t imagine it’d go this far.
‘Be nice,’ Avery whispers.
Sam is nice.
He’s obviously fixing it up for Vin.
Is that why she likes him?
The place is open.
An unfamiliar man talks with a customer over a car.
Sam’s chest aches.
Sam is nice instead of punching Vin in the throat.
He knows he’s being unreasonable.
The girl is just being decent.
No one seems angry.
She might think the backpack is full of coins, right?
Sam’s a thief.
Coins are logical.
Sam scrambles for his seatbelt.
She circuits them and pauses by the water edge.
‘Hey!’ Sam’s voice echoes, too shrill.
He springs forward.
The cry that escapes Sam’s lips is hardly human.
I’m letting you go now.
His cheeks are wet.
His backpack is gone.
‘He told me about your crazy habit.’ He told.
He doesn’t even understand when he shouldn’t.
But how long has he known about the keys?
I need a kid like you.
A good lock pick.
‘But you need to shed the baby face.
I mean look at you, kid.
You’re crying over a backpack.
He couldn’t even explain it to Avery.
The keys were promises.
They were all he had.
He doesn’t struggle.
But his arms hang loose at his sides.
Avery knew Vin was going to do this.
Drugs?’ Vin gives a laugh and slides on aviator sunglasses.
‘I know you’re only a kid, so come on.
I’ll buy you some chips on the way back.
Except he doesn’t want to die.
We gut houses like you do.
They have no idea.
It’s not about the stealing from houses.
It’s about stealing the houses.
Right now, his lungs are rust.
He follows Vin.
Avery drops down on the sofa where Sam’s sprawled.
Avery pokes the back of his neck.
Sam doesn’t react.
‘I looked at them when you slept.
All the time.
‘But Vin says—’ Sam flips channels faster.
‘Still glittery.’ ‘Surprise,’ Sam says, flat.
Isn’t it painfully obvious?
Avery chews his thumbnail, eyes on the TV.
‘I can take care of myself.’ That’s a hilarious joke.
‘You didn’t tell me how you got caught,’ Avery says.
Avery looks worried and Sam’s story trails off.
It doesn’t matter anyway.
There are things with sharper edges to unpack.
Sam’s still isn’t sure how old she is.
And it always seems like a rehearsed act.
She dumps the greasy paper bag on the coffee table.
Then she kisses Avery on the mouth.
She kisses a lot of different people, Sam’s noticed.
But talking about kissing and sex is too awkward, OK?
It shouldn’t be Sam’s job.
He’s only fifteen.
Except it always is his job.
She flops in a sofa and unwraps hers.
Vin hasn’t figured it out?
Or is this another thing she’s fixing?
Eat your food mixed.
Sam entirely hates Vin.
Why is Avery putting up with it though?
Because he likes her?
Sam feels sick.
Vin licks juice off her thumb.
‘How old are you anyway, Sammy?
Fourteen?’ Sam frowns.
He doesn’t want to do stuff like that.
Vin’s eyes narrow.
She gets her teeth whitened to prove it.
A muscle twitches in Sam’s jaw.
All of it.
Sam springs towards it, tripping over boxes of stacked junk.
Avery’s up hard against the wall.
Her eyes are bottomless and frigid.
‘—don’t disagree with me,’ Vin is saying.
That kid can fit.’ ‘I said n-no.’ Avery’s voice shakes.
His voice takes on a desperate edge.
He springs into the kitchen and shoves Vin off.
Cutlery slips and clatters to the floor.
Blood sprays hot over Sam’s fingers.
Avery gives a startled yell and grabs Sam’s waist.
‘Sammy, don’t—’ But fire blazes in Sam’s lungs.
Every time he explodes.
Blood soaks her shirt.
‘Don’t don’t.’ His voice cracks.
‘D-don’t hit people.
He can’t feel anything.
He’s spun out of invincible clouds.
Vin raises bloody fingers towards the door.
‘Get out.’ Sam’s anger is cooling, leaving his hands shaking.
‘Fine.’ His voice feels far away.
Tries to grab his wrist.
Avery jerks back.
Vin’s voice explodes.
A door slams upstairs.
How could he scare his brother?
He trips on the threshold.
Then she hurls him out and slams the door.
He waits an hour.
The lock comes apart under Sam’s thin, light fingers.
Except right now, Avery doesn’t want to be around him.
Sam scared his brother.
He scared his brother.
He has to stop doing this, losing it.
There’s nothing to take except handfuls of cobwebs.
Close your eyes and pretend this is a bed.
Pretend you don’t smell stale air and mouse bait.
Was she ever happy with them?
He puts in the De Lainey father.
And then a handful of De Lainey kids.
Her eyes meet his, chocolate curls spilling across her cheeks.
His words come cracked as a broken plate.
The bush waves encouragingly at him.
Sam clears his throat.
‘This is an apology present.
I didn’t steal it.
‘I’m sorry?’ The bush does not accept his apology.
But he has to try.
He doesn’t have anything to lose.
He doesn’t have anything.
His shoulders ache for his backpack.
You’re not allowed to think about Vin.
Or how you scared Avery so much he stayed.
They need their own home.
This can’t go well.
He’s so screwed.
He didn’t take a single key.
He feels sick whenever he sees them now.
Get up, you spineless coward.
His fingers curl to knock and then hesitate.
His heart stutters.
Sam awkwardly holds out the thread.
It’s so tiny.
He’s such an idiot.
Confusion fades from her face and fury washes down.
‘I’m sorry,’ Sam says.
Moxie slams the door in his face.
Well, that’s fair.
He deserves that.
Boys covered in concrete dust vault out.
‘Hey, is that Sammy?’ He can’t do this.
He doesn’t want to be hit.
‘Sam, wait!’ One of the twins strides around the rosebushes.
Sam’s stupid to come back.
That his fists weren’t raised.
That maybe he wanted to talk, not to hit.
He can’t go back to Avery.
Or the De Laineys’.
He’s so, so tired.
It’s nearly five.
She knocks off from the petrol station around now.
She used to.
He hasn’t been back in over a year.
Her fingers close around shopping bags before she sees him.
Like maybe he can make himself look younger, innocent, sorry.
What should he say?
He forces his feet forward.
Tuna, it looks like, powdered milk and rye crackers.
‘Are the police chasing you?’ Well, obviously.
‘Where’s Avery?’ Aunt Karen says.
She lets him.
‘He’s OK.’ No, he’s not.
‘He, um, works a real job.
With a mechanic.’ A lie now.
‘Just you.’ Sam looks down.
His shoelaces are undone.
‘Nothing.’ Sam’s mouth is full of cotton.
‘I’m not taking you back,’ Aunt Karen says.
‘You go inside my house and I’m calling the police.
I can see your hands, Sammy.
Still hitting people?
Do you know what you deserve?
To be locked up.
No second chances.
She won’t budge for that either.
‘Sorry is not enough,’ Aunt Karen says, vicious.
‘But can I just have one night?
Sam looks desperately at her back, needing her to understand.
Truly stop and see him.
He runs after her, heart falling through his chest.
Her hand shoots up and cracks across his face.
It takes a moment for the sting to catch up.
Sam stares, his mouth open, red fingerprints across his cheekbone.
‘I was protecting him,’ Sam whispers.
‘You like the power you get from hurting people.
You’re just like your father.’ Sam can’t speak.
That’s not him.
That’s never him.
Trying to keep himself here.
‘Don’t talk about Avery like that,’ he whispers.
It’s like she doesn’t hear him.
Aunt Karen says, voice suddenly crisp.
‘Are you coming inside?
You can sit down while I call you in.
You know you deserve it, Sammy Lou.’ A cute name.
Just Sammy Lou.
Does he deserve it?
you do you do you do you do He turns.
He walks away.
‘I thought so,’ Aunt Karen calls.
Her shoulders stay stiff.
Her face sets.
Or broken bones.
He’s having a rough life.
High school sucks.
He’s aware of how different he is now.
It’s stupid, wanting friends.
But Sammy understands.
He wouldn’t mind a friend.
Sammy’s worried school will kill Avery.
But he can fix this, right?
He fixes everything.
He scales it like Spiderman.
Hand over hand, propelled by momentum and sheer will.
But he’s up.
A happy shout.
Avery pulls his hood off.
‘I’ll catch the moon and steal it.
Are you coming?’ Avery is coming.
Note to self: stop babying him already.
But it’s fine.
He’s just happy.
Sammy can breathe again.
And it’s good.
Everything is good.
He jumps again and again.
And he can take what he wants.
‘Get down right now.
Sammy!’ Get down and get your ears slapped, she means.
Sammy nudges Avery with his elbow.
‘Together?’ ‘You,’ Avery whispers, ‘and me.
Aunt Karen hollers at them.
They smack together as they tumble through the split.
They tangle for a second in the uncut lawn.
The trampoline waves torn threads in apology.
‘Anything broken?’ Sammy says.
She’ll lock them out.
But so what?
He throws his arm over Avery’s shoulder.
They’re height for height right now.
‘We are the kings of nowhere,’ Sammy says.
‘We only need us.’ He’s a very good liar.
The wallet is hot and heavy in Sam’s sweat-slick hands.
Sam has a headache.
From sun beating on his bare head?
From sleeping on the ground?
Except he doesn’t want to.
He just doesn’t care any more.
Seaglass necklaces and hand-painted bowls and boxes of postcards.
‘That’s ten for two, boy,’ the old woman says.
Three times what she asked for.
But they’re making him sick.
‘This OK?’ he says.
The first person to smile at him in days.
When is he going to understand that it’s over?
She slammed the door in his face.
What’s it going to take for him to stop?
The police to show up?
He should turn a few days into for ever days.
Do everyone a favour.
Come on, cut the self-loathing.
The scrolls of material fit nicely in two hands.
Pity he’s soaking them with sweat.
He needs to get himself together.
He’s an embarrassment.
Feet patter inside.
The doorhandles twist and then pauses.
She knows it’s him, doesn’t she?
‘Oh my God.’ Her voice is flat.
‘Because you, um, s-sew,’ he says.
‘Were you actually living upstairs like a creepy psycho?
Like … why?
I had nowhere to go, he wants to say.
I’m the boy of nothing and nowhere.
‘I checked with all my brothers.’ Moxie’s eyes narrows.
‘None of them knows you.
But that’s it.
She slams the door.
Sam leaves without another word.
The front door is open again.
She doesn’t call out after him.
But he notices the material is tucked under her arm.
‘Oh, boyfriend?’ the florist says.
‘I mean, she’s not my girlfriend.
The florist looks at him.
He’s scraping together twenty-cent pieces until he lifts another wallet.
Well, she’ll most likely do that anyway.
Why is he doing this?
This is all wrong.
The sympathetic look in her eyes startles him.
‘How mad are we talking?’ the florist says.
‘Because flowers send a message, you know.
He should’ve lifted another wallet.
Destroying more than fixing.
Sam left alone.
Yeah, OK, stop.
‘Well.’ Sam shakes the hair out of his eyes.
‘Which I’m not,’ Sam adds, quickly, looking up.
‘I’m not a creeper.
‘Ouch.’ The florist taps her manicured fingernails on the countertop.
‘I just want to say sorry.
I don’t …’ He swallows.
She folds her arms, surveying them.
Sam trails after her.
‘Chivalry is not dead!
And you’re kind of adorable.
‘Follow.’ He does.
‘I only have five dollars,’ Sam says.
The florist smiles.
He tried to take the florist’s advice.
He really tried.
But at least his tangles have been tamed?
And … a lot of glitter resurfaced.
Consequently he has the worst sunburn over his pale shoulders.
But he did an OK job, right?
That will not help.
Deep in the house, a baby wails.
Maybe she didn’t hear?
Her frown intensifies.
‘You,’ she says.
Possibly proof his intentions are honourable.
Possibly a shield.
Stand up straight.
Look her in the eye.
Don’t lose it.
‘I just want to say sorry,’ he says.
Which is exactly what he is.
He falls off with a shriek of laughter.
She hasn’t slammed the door.
He’s maybe got five seconds.
‘When you were away.
‘You all thought I was someone else’s friend.
So I stayed.
I swear it was an accident.’ Moxie’s scowl remains.
‘You lost me there.’ Moxie gestures to her shirt.
Gingerly, Sam offers the box of chocolates.
She takes the box.
‘And you’re not forgiven.’ But she took the chocolates.
Sam’s heart dares to beat again.
She looks curious.
She plucks a chocolate and bites.
Then flush out the pool.
Then fill it.
The hose is pointing at Sam.
Sam gets a faceful of water.
Laughing is good, right?
Because it seems she’s accepted the apology.
‘So you’re homeless,’ Moxie says.
Not like a question.
Sam’s caramel gets suddenly stuck in his throat.
‘Not around,’ he says.
I just – I make do.’ ‘In my house, clearly.
‘No.’ Moxie looks away again.
‘It was … it was my mum’s space.
He’s said the wrong thing.
‘No, my mum died.’ Moxie’s voice is strangely emotionless.
She … she had it after Dash was born too.
That’s why there’s like seven years between Dash and Toby.
Moxie doesn’t seem fazed.
But he doesn’t have conversational skills.
That’s … that’s exactly what it feels like.
‘Met properly,’ Moxie concedes.
Moxie looks pointedly at his arms.
‘I didn’t tell anyone that either.
‘I have to tell my dad the truth.
‘I’ll go.’ He knows this is the end.
Walking to nowhere.
‘Wait.’ Moxie stands too.
‘My dad could help you.
And there’s other stuff.
‘I can’t go to prison.
I just can’t.
He’d never cope.
Moxie chews her lip, her face strangely vulnerable.
I get it.’ There’s silence.
‘I can’t cook,’ Moxie says, very suddenly.
‘I burn everything.
It’s a literal nightmare.’ Sam remembers scrubbing the blackened pot.
‘Do you know how to make pancakes?’ she says.
He also pretends he’s not watching Moxie.
Moxie takes this in with thin lips.
‘You don’t seem like an axe murderer,’ she says finally.
And you were OK-ish that Sunday.’ ‘OK-ish?’ Sam repeats.
‘Oops.’ He turns huge brown eyes up at Sam.
Moxie has a very satisfied look on her face.
He flips pancakes.
And Sam makes a fine pancake.
They’re crisp around the edges and perfectly cooked inside.
Moxie tears a pancake in half.
‘I know you excel at dishes, so have at it.
‘No!’ Moxie eyeballs him.
‘Oh yes, sir.
He does feel bad for her.
He obviously has the easier job here.
For an easy grab and run.
Absolutely pitiful, Sam.
Scared of leaving.
His leg bounces.
He’s so close to Moxie and she smells of marmalade.
‘You made this?’ he says.
Moxie stretches her shirt out a little to admire it.
He never wants to go.
Sam’s smile is sheepish.
He can’t focus.
Sits beside him.
And she knows who and what he is.
‘No, you missed it.
Moxie’s body relaxes and her shoulder leans against his.
The pressure is warm and soft and everything.
And he falls into it.
Just a little.
But for the barest moment between patchwork frowns, he’s wanted.
He falls asleep.
How could he?
Sam snaps awake so fast that he swallows his heart.
Moxie is gone.
And the house is anything but quiet.
‘Dad said we’d knock off at three.
LANGUAGE.’ Sam is suffocating.
But this time he has nowhere to hide.
‘Jack perpetually smells like a sewer.
I was cutting timber with Dad.
Directly on to Sam.
Sam catches it with his face.
‘Oh,’ says Jack, backtracking to stare.
He has to run.
He has to run right now.
‘My friend Sam is staying for dinner,’ she announces.
‘And isn’t it Jack’s night to cook?
He narrows his eyes at Moxie.
‘Language.’ ‘Sorry.’ Moxie raises her hands innocently.
‘I’m overworked and underpaid,’ Jack says.
Moxie waves vaguely at the room.
‘Wait, he’s your friend?
‘Hmm, oops.’ Considering his recent decisions, she’s not wrong.
‘Let’s worry about that later.
‘You look tired, Sam.
But not on the topic she has in mind.
A dress dummy displays a pinned outfit of emerald green.
Moxie’s smile is wry.
Dinner is loud and messy and intoxicatingly alive.
Also because he’s far away from Mr De Lainey.
Sam just … he can’t with adults.
They frown, they shout, they hit.
Just in case.
The baby faceplants in a bowl of sauce.
Moxie pokes Sam’s leg under the table.
‘He’s the softest squish you’ll ever meet.
Sam shovels in food to hide the smile.
‘So, Moxie.’ Mr De Lainey clears his throat.
‘You’re taking my weekend now?’ Her father sighs.
‘Moxie …’ ‘Oh, it’s fine.’ Moxie’s teeth clench.
Moxie snatches her fork and stabs a meatball.
‘No,’ Moxie snaps.
‘No and no.’ The baby’s lip juts out.
‘Seriously, Moxie?’ Jack says.
‘You never have to look after them.
I’m only fifteen.
I’m a kid too.
‘All right, let’s calm down,’ Mr De Lainey says.
No one listens.
‘I never get to stop,’ Moxie shoots back.
‘Who got up for the baby last night?
‘Who’s been up since five with Toby?
But in that moment, his heart tugs for Moxie.
He gets it.
A life tangled with siblings who can’t look after themselves?
Sam gets it.
‘We all miss Mum,’ Jack says.
‘Grady,’ Mr De Lainey calls, sounding a little desperate.
‘Hey, just wait a —’ The front door bangs.
Mr De Lainey puts his head in his hands.
Jack snaps garlic bread in half.
‘Come on.’ It’s a command.
They sweep upstairs and leave the clatter of crying below.
But she doesn’t.
‘I’ve seen worse,’ Sam says.
He should not have said anything.
‘Long time ago.’ ‘OK, wow.
I am such a jerk.’ ‘No …’ Sam’s heart thuds.
It’s – you’re allowed to hurt.
‘I really miss my mum,’ Moxie says.
Sam looks out the window at the darkening sky.
‘I should go.’ Sam doesn’t move.
He thinks of the school.
He’d give anything to stay like this.
‘Just sleep in the office again,’ she says finally.
She presents fingers of glitter in proof.
He can’t do this.
He doesn’t know how.
Shouts and voices have dimmed as kids load into buses.
His shirt is inside out, collar popped, tags fluttering.
He looks happy.
Sammy stares at him.
‘I kissed Elle,’ Avery says.
Stop.’ Sammy pulls the paper out of his nose.
‘You’re talking way too fast.’ Not just talking.
He’s going way too fast for Sammy to keep up.
He’s going too fast.
He’s not like them.
He’s going to get hurt.
‘You can’t go around kissing.
Sammy tries to steady himself.
He’s not ready for this kind of conversation with Avery.
‘Because,’ he says, closing his eyes, ‘they’re messing with you.
To hurt you.’ Avery frowns.
Isn’t that nice for him?
His bottom lip juts out and he looks wounded.
‘I could earn money, right?
Sammy has the dull feeling that he’s being manipulated.
‘Did you say you’re going with them now?’ Sammy says.
Not the kind of people Sammy wants Avery around.
All crass jokes and cold smirks.
Does Sammy want Avery around anyone?
He picks friends badly.
‘You’re not going to anyone’s house,’ Sammy says.
‘We’re going back to Aunt Karen’s.’ Avery’s eyes narrow.
How’s Sam supposed to explain?
He doesn’t know how to let go of Avery.
Doesn’t think it’s the right time.
‘You can’t have both.
It’s like being a kid versus growing up.
A reason amongst millions that he’s not ready for this.
Avery pulls the toy car out of his pocket.
He flips it over with long thin fingers, staring.
Sammy tests his nose.
Avery bounces to his feet.
One waves him over.
Sammy’s fingers close over the toy car.
‘Please, just listen.
‘I mean,’ Sammy says, teeth grating, ‘under your clothes.
If clothes cover it, you can’t touch it.
It’s the rule, OK?
‘You hit people.
That’s worse than anything West does.
It’s bad, Sammy.
It’s so so bad.’ Sammy’s teeth clench.
‘I didn’t hit anyone.
I promised I’d stop, didn’t I?
They jumped me.’ Avery flicks his fingers by his ear.
He doesn’t belong to just you.
His smile is puppy-dog wide.
Innocent and anxiously excited.
West drapes an arm over his shoulder.
Laughs at him.
Or with him?
Sammy looks down at the toy car in his hand.
A tear hits it, hot and wet.
He’s stupid to be crying.
Their routine becomes pleasantly seamless after a week.
They come out faster the more he’s around Moxie.
Wow, he actually has opinions.
This could be you.’ Sam looks up, alarmed.
You’d need to cut your hair though.
‘But do you actually like it long?
Because you could just get it tidied.
He’s a sticky mess.
‘I’ll cut it.’ There’s a dangerous spark in her eyes.
Sam is decidedly nervous.
And he doesn’t want to see disgust in her eyes.
She ruffles fingers through his hair.
‘And what cities have you felled today?
You’re next, Jack.
‘He’s going to get the shower first,’ Jack says.
Jeremy clambers through the gate.
They’re friends … right?
Moxie snorts and waits till they’re gone before scooting closer.
Spiderwebs of sensations dart across his skull.
The scissors snip.
Wisps of corn silk strands drop on to Sam’s shoulders.
‘It would look so good on you.
But I’m …’ ‘Remarkably pretty.
She fluffs hair out from behind his ears.
Can she feel them burning hot?
Moxie jerks back.
‘Oh no.’ Sam’s shoulders straighten.
‘What do you mean “oh no”?’ ‘Um.’ Panic hits.
‘Moxie.’ ‘OK, OK, don’t stress.
I just …’ There’s a tense pause.
‘JEREMY,’ she hollers.
‘What’s going on?
Moxie.’ ‘I don’t understand,’ Moxie says.
‘I watched three tutorials.’ ‘That is confusing,’ Jeremy says.
Sam drops his face in his hands.
It’s considerably less exhilarating.
‘Shorter at the sides and longer at the top.
Sam’s going to be bald.
‘You have a buzz cut,’ Sam says, voice thin.
Moxie takes a bite of his sandwich.
‘Hey,’ he says.
‘He donated it to cancer kids.
How long did it get, Jeremy?
And totally unfocused.
Sam resists covering his ears in hopes of protecting them.
‘You were majestic,’ Moxie says.
A lot of hair.
‘Go find a mirror.’ ‘I don’t want to,’ Sam says.
It’s not too bad.
His head feels strangely naked and he can actually see.
‘Well, wow, Jeremy!
Then he notices Jeremy’s looking at his ribs.
‘It’s nothing.’ Sam looks away.
‘The ribs, however.’ ‘Unacceptable,’ says Jeremy.
‘He’s staying for dinner right, Moxie?
‘But really, Sam.
Any time.’ Sunshine crackles back into his eyes.
‘I’m making brownies.’ He ducks back into the house.
‘Make it caramel!’ Moxie yells at his back.
‘That was fun.’ Sam itches his neck.
‘Not really, no.’ ‘And you have a whole face.
She musses his hair again, frowning as she arranges it.
She’s so close, her hands all through his hair.
‘I like your eyes,’ she says.
She has no idea, does she?
What she does to his heart.
Sympathy is not her strong point.
He’ll check on him tomorrow.
Make sure he’s eating.
Make sure he’s not on the edge of a meltdown.
‘Mayfair,’ she crows.
‘Hey, don’t do that,’ Jeremy says, petting him tenderly.
‘Phone.’ Jack looks helplessly at Jeremy.
‘He started—’ His father snaps his fingers.
‘Soon,’ Moxie says fiercely.
His chest tugs.
Two weeks is a lot of lying.
‘OK, take it off,’ Moxie says.
‘Half the time they just text me anyway.
It’s like, expected.’ ‘Dad picks on me,’ Jack says.
Moxie reappears with an armful of garments.
‘Who do I kill with this?’ Sam says.
‘That’s an unpicker, you goat.
And these are second-hand clothes.
Jack makes an exasperated sound.
Sam swivels the small torture instrument.
It feels like a lock pick.
‘Since they’re all completely useless.’ ‘Excuse me,’ Jeremy says.
Last year, I think.’ ‘I rest my case,’ Moxie mutters.
Grady appears, rubbing his eyes until his glasses are askew.
‘What’d I miss?’ ‘Everything,’ Moxie says.
‘Why don’t you just buy clothes?
Save time.’ Moxie slams her scissors down, nostrils flaring.
‘Oh, here we go,’ Jeremy says.
Grady slides on to the bench across from Sam.
‘This seems unfair,’ Jeremy comments.
‘You can’t even cook.’ Moxie’s frown is lemon.
I can heat up lasagne.
I look after the kids all the time now.
Then she writes Jack and gives him a one.
Jack throws his Monopoly money.
The pen hesitates.
Then Moxie gives him an eight.
‘All right, this is rigged.’ Jeremy frowns.
‘I should be worth more than Sam.
His glare levels mountains.
‘Why are you rating Sam so high?
Moxie’s lemon frown is back.
‘Jack.’ Jack slams his hand against the wall.
‘Jack,’ the De Lainey father snaps.
Then he stomps upstairs.
He grins like a delighted Cheshire Cat.
Jeremy and Grady exchange smirks.
‘Sam is a lovely shade of red,’ Grady says.
‘He’s sunburnt.’ She cuts a sideways glance at Sam.
He wants to whisper, do you have a crush?
But his tongue is stuck, his breathing shallow.
It’d be so much worse if she did.
Boys like him don’t get the girl.
They go to jail.
It’s seven thirty in the morning.
He’s a mountain of a man, but flus don’t discriminate.
‘Dad,’ she says, ‘we’re totally out of food.
Moxie smiles at him, surprised and entirely pleased.
Drive me to the shops!’ Silence.
‘Jeremy cannot return your calls right now,’ he says.
Moxie narrows her eyes.
‘Did he come home last night?
‘Right, he’s grounded.’ He sneezes.
Moxie hands him the whole tissue box.
‘Where’s Grady?’ Jack bounces downstairs.
‘Then Jack can go shopping,’ Moxie says.
Panic lights Jack’s eyes.
But I’ve sunk a lot into it.
Too much.’ He rubs his reddened eyes.
‘Jack, can you grab the emergency cash in the office?
‘Just to tide us over.’ Jack folds his arms.
Mr De Lainey sighs.
Moxie snaps her fingers at Jack.
‘Get the money.
‘Dad needs a twelveyear nap.
The baby clings to her leg and sniffles.
Jack returns, car keys jingling.
He’s over keys.
‘I couldn’t find any money in the office,’ Jack says.
That’d be great, Sam.
I think I’m about to keep you.’ He smiles.
‘We’re going to live off gruel.’ Moxie’s voice turns dangerous.
‘Listen here, Jack.
Moxie’s smile is sweet poison.
Usually he fits with Moxie.
He bobs up and down awkwardly.
Jack eyes him and then snorts.
‘You look ridiculous.
It stops crying and looks interested.
Jack has a devilish spark in his eyes.
People jump clear with gasps.
The baby shrieks in delight.
Then Jack attempts to slow them down— and fails.
‘Ow,’ Sam says with a broken face.
The baby pats his cheek.
‘Ow-ow, Sammy.’ Moxie storms over.
He raises his arms in self-defence.
‘Jack’s idea.’ Moxie whirls on Jack.
‘You’re a terrible influence on him.
‘Why are you still smiling?
But his pockets are empty.
And Moxie said he was turning into a De Lainey.
Sammy is fourteen and there are knives in his belly.
He’s so hungry.
He’s fast now.
Fast at locks.
Slow to notice his brother cracking around the edges.
The bunk bed creaks.
A small thump.
‘I know you’re freaking out about something.
He could eat nine right now.
‘Is my brain broken?’ Sammy stiffens.
He stays very still.
‘They and the others … they copy me.
Like when I tic and—’ He stops.
‘They think I don’t get that they’re laughing at me.
But I do.’ ‘There’s nothing wrong with you.’ Silence.
‘Did they do something to you?
You have to tell me, OK?
He groans and knuckles his eyes.
‘I won’t hit anyone.
A shudder runs across Avery’s thin shoulders.
‘Avery?’ Sammy whispers.
‘Please talk to me.’ Avery starts to cry.
They come back with treasure.
Peculiar costumes to rip apart.
Strange tins of buttons.
Odd hats to remake.
He sold the desk from the office.
He hasn’t mentioned the missing money again.
Sam sifts through buttons.
Avery would love doing this.
Sam is consumed with sorting and nothing else.
Because this he can do.
This is safe.
Time to put on popcorn.
The keys stare at him with rows of metallic teeth.
The wallet is old, seams popping.
Just … don’t.
He sees Mr De Lainey’s disappointed eyes.
Avery’s understanding slice of a smile.
He owed everything to those keys.
Fingers shaking, he unhooks the house key.
He puts it in his pocket.
He doesn’t touch the wallet.
The pocketed key digs into his thigh.
whywhywhywhy what if they saw— Sam takes a breath.
No one saw.
Moxie will come down soon.
‘Saaaaammy,’ Jack says.
‘Sam.’ Jeremy pats Sam’s knee.
Sam does the logical thing – he panics.
They’ll see what a miserable pathetic creep he is.
Who steals house keys?
Who does that?
Mischief lights Jack’s eyes.
Then he stiffens right back up.
‘Since you’re here so much,’ Jeremy says.
This is worse than being caught with the key.
‘I haven’t …’ Sam says.
‘Dude, she has so.
Remember that kid with the glasses last year?
‘Sam is practically a live-in.’ They have no idea.
‘Shut up.’ Jeremy is calmly pleasant.
‘And you’ll kill me if I hurt her?
That’s cliché, guys.’ ‘Moxie can pound you herself,’ Jeremy says.
‘Why so complicated?
Just say we’ll kill him.’ ‘We’ll kill you,’ says Jack.
‘Bloodily.’ ‘Well, I’m not doing anything.’ Sam clutches buttons.
There’s a pause.
‘Sometimes the babies need helpful hints.
There’s a thump on the stairs and then Moxie appears.
Her brows tighten in that trademark lemon scowl.
‘We’re just giving him the safe sex talk.’ Sam chokes.
Jeremy whacks him helpfully on the back.
Moxie folds her arms.
Moxie is pure darkness.
‘Would you like to bet?’ ‘We’d tell Dad,’ Jack says.
‘You guys aren’t allowed to drink?’ Sam says.
Safe and strict.
So no drinking.
Or swearing.’ ‘Or sex,’ Jack adds.
Moxie smiles sweetly.
How could I forget?
All our friends thought we’d died.’ Jack looks like murder.
‘I hate you, Moxie.’ She batters her eyelashes.
I have stuff to do!
Moxie plops down beside Sam.
He resists the urge to close his fingers around it.
What’s wrong with him?
Sam’s voice is soft.
‘I guess you’ll have to tell them soon.
‘Lie down,’ she says.
His world grows crushingly tight.
He doesn’t know what to do.
What he’s allowed to feel.
She puts a hand on his chest.
Spreads her fingers out.
He’s holding Moxie.
He will never move again.
‘We should probably talk,’ Moxie says.
Sam closes his eyes.
I shouldn’t—’ ‘No.
I wouldn’t change a single day.
It’s been … it’s been perfect.
It sucked, OK?
And I want to scream.
He wants to be— something.
Someone to her.
Then I found you.
What does he say?
He doesn’t want it to end?
He doesn’t want to leave?
To lose her?
‘You snuck up on me, Sam.
I like you.
‘I like you quite a lot too,’ he whispers.
A smile curves half her lips.
‘AHEM.’ Moxie shrieks and falls backwards off the sofa.
Sam shoots upright, guilt plastered thickly on his face.
‘But Dad said Sam can spend the night.
So long as he calls his parents.’ He pauses.
‘He stays on the sofa.
While Moxie stays in her room.
Like he hasn’t been staying here for weeks.
Jeremy looks confused.
Wow, you weirdos.’ He turns to go and then backtracks.
‘I guess you don’t need advice, Sammy.’ He winks.
Sam pulls a pillow over his face.
Moxie shoots a suspicious look from one to the other.
‘Excuse me?’ ‘Nothing.’ Jeremy cheerfully flees.
‘It’s like I live here or something,’ he says.
‘It’s like you live here or something,’ she agrees.
Someone always smuggles alcohol and we light a bonfire.
It’s like the last holiday hurrah.’ ‘I … can’t.
If someone knows me—’ ‘No one’s going to know you.
No one will recognise him.
She smacks his chest.
Because, for starters, it’s a waistcoat.
‘Obviously,’ he says.
‘I’ll finish my dress,’ she says.
To being utterly invisible.
A shutter tips over her eyes.
‘Can we talk about it later?
We’ll work it out.
I’m not going to say goodbye.’ Her voice is fierce.
He wants to tell her everything.
That he steals keys because he’s desperate to belong.
She kisses him.
He tips his head up to catch it.
She’s soft and warm, summer nights and sugar.
His brain shuts off.
His hands circle her back.
He did something wrong.
Of course he did.
He screwed it— ‘I’m sorry,’ he’s saying, breathless and panicked.
‘Well, that I can tell.
Sam’s hands start to shake.
She tilts his chin up.
‘You have a lot of practice to do.
It’s OK to move your face, you know.
‘Perfect,’ she says.
Then kisses him again.
It matches her hair.
Blood and fire.
Her lips curl with disapproval.
Or hide her.
It tumbles out in anguish.
It’s never a tantrum.
Moxie’s fingers curl over Sam’s arm.
‘Who is she?
Engine still running.
She’s going to wake up the whole house.
‘I have to go.’ Sam turns to Moxie, desperate now.
‘Please, just …’ Just what, Sam?
Just what the hell will you tell her?
‘Tell me what’s going on!’ Moxie cries from the doorway.
He gets into Vin’s car.
All he has is a desperate need for Avery.
‘Tell me what happened.’ Sam’s voice is too high.
‘Where is he?
At your place?
Since he can’t shut up.
Vin’s only kindness is truly selfishness.
The car spins downtown.
‘He’s autistic.’ Sam grinds each word like crushed glass.
And you threw it all at him?
It’s like being hit in the stomach.
Sam rips out of his seat before they even stop.
He doesn’t hear Vin follow.
His own work.
His world is spinning out from under him.
He screams and screams.
They’ve pushed him too much.
‘No, just leave him alone.
I’ve got him.
Sam’s selfish fault.
His screams pitch higher.
Calm him down with pressure.
Avery’s fist connects with Sam’s stomach.
again Sam takes it all with the smallest grunt.
Sam doesn’t care.
‘You’re OK.’ ‘I c-c-c-can’t—’ ‘You don’t have to,’ Sam whispers.
‘I got you.
… embarrassing me, she’d said.
How’s he going to move Avery?
They have nowhere to go.
Life is always so sickeningly cruel.
Sam holds him tighter.
He knows where to go.
He can’t be doing this.
He’ll ruin everything.
He’s doing this.
He hates being this cruel.
Avery’s soul is bleeding out.
But they made it.
She’ll be furious he ran out like that.
Their kiss, so sweet before, feels like memories of ash.
The shirt is probably Jeremy’s.
Sam has so much stealing to apologise for.
‘I c-c-c-can’t …’ He stops.
A sob tears free.
Pressure to calm him.
Avery’s breathing slows as Sam holds him tight.
A sandwich of Lou boys in a stolen house.
‘We have to be quiet,’ Sam whispers.
‘But tomorrow I … I’m going to fix it.
No, the De Laineys are not like that.
Failing owning one, Sam decided to be one.
‘I’m … I’m sorry I wasn’t there.
Then he goes completely still.
A small sigh escapes.
Sam would save him a million times.
He’d never hesitate.
But you can’t hide Avery.
Sam’s perfect summer is a hot slap against his cheek.
He wakes to a toe in his ribs.
Sam jerks toward the sofa but it’s empty.
‘I need explanations,’ she says.
‘Many of them.
‘What the hell, Sam?’ He kneads his eyes.
‘My … my brother needed help.’ Where is he?
But I have to ask now, Sam.
‘Is this your autistic brother?
Is he safe right now?’ ‘I don’t know,’ Sam whispers.
‘We need to tell my dad,’ she says.
He opens his mouth to – what?
Maybe just agree?
Do you have an extremely cute and slightly taller doppelgänger?
Because one is currently abusing our poor gate.
Sam left his heartbeat inside.
But Avery’s OK.
‘Where’d you go?’ Sam says softly.
‘Come back inside.
His eyes are smudged with exhaustion, his lips bitten bloody.
‘If you tell, they’ll s-send you to jail,’ he says.
‘All … this?
Sunday night waffles.
Lying on the grass with mango pips.
Sam leans across the gate.
‘I’ll risk it for you.
I rebuilt her car.’ His split lips tip downwards.
‘Don’t be like that.’ Sam’s voice stays low.
‘You really can’t.’ Heat flares in Sam’s chest.
‘You just fall apart.
He looks wretched, tired and hollowed out.
Sam’s throat closes.
‘I like your hands better this way,’ Avery says.
Sam looks down in confusion.
His knuckles are smooth.
‘Vin says you’re soft.
‘You don’t belong in a house,’ Avery says.
‘We’re the kings of nowhere, remember?
No one can solve the puzzle that is Sammy Lou.
They shouldn’t even try.
‘You can call Vin if you need me.
But I’m leaving now.’ If he needs Avery?
More like when Avery needs him.
But he thinks Avery means it.
He thinks Avery’s trying to be a big brother.
Sam could laugh.
Or maybe just cry.
But he doesn’t.
‘After the beach party,’ Moxie says.
‘Then we’re officially talking to my dad.
About everything.’ He just nods.
No, he’s not.
Sam looks down at his fingers wrapped around Avery’s phone.
Sam stitches on a pretend smile.
But having dozens of eyes look at him?
He loathes that.
Six pairs of eyes immediately lock on Sam.
You look incredible.
The waistcoat is marvellous.
It’s burgundy and rust and charcoal and gold.
And it’s slim fitting.
No one will know.
He needs it.
No one has ever called Sam a gentleman before.
He can’t think about it right now.
Jack doesn’t look up from his phone.
‘The sun’s not fully down yet.
‘No,’ says Jack.
‘What have you been doing all this time?’ Moxie says.
Mr De Lainey pops raisins in his mouth.
‘Well.’ He pauses.
‘Well … you need pants.’ Jeremy looks down.
‘Oh, yeah.’ ‘And a different shirt,’ Jack adds, stealing gingerbread.
Jeremy nods several times and bolts back upstairs.
I need to wear a salmon.
OK.’ Moxie glances at Jack.
‘Does he have a new crush?
Is that why he’s flapping?’ Jack shrugs.
‘No.’ Jack puts his phone behind his back.
Their father sighs and looks very old.
Sam nudges Moxie with his knee.
Whatever that means.
But the dress has a secret.
The skirt flares out to a perfect circle.
She is the sun and her eyes burn stars.
Her smile is glory and pride and infectious delight.
Mr De Lainey looks like he’s about to cry.
‘Moxie, darling, you’re beautiful.
I’m taking a picture.
Everyone on the stairs!
They shuffle and poke each other.
Jeremy leans on Grady.
Dash picks up Toby.
A stray curl falls over Moxie’s eyes.
They share a smile.
It really, really hurts.
He can’t lose this.
The beach is a fairyland of lights like broken stars.
‘It’s mostly kids from school,’ Grady says.
‘And their friends and friends of friends.
The rich ones started it.
Rich kids get away with a lot.’ Sam won’t argue.
Sam ignores his tightening lungs.
Everything clashes together.
Don’t freak out.
No one knows you.
There is no way anyone here will recognise you.
‘Anyway, why are you saying “we”?
‘Loser.’ The crowd swallows them.
Grady lays a hand on Sam and Moxie’s shoulders.
‘I’m nineteen, not ninety.
And all my old school friends still come.
Also Isla’s here.’ He clears his throat.
‘So no drinking.’ ‘Obviously.’ Moxie folds her arms.
‘Don’t wander off someplace dark.’ Grady shudders.
‘Ha,’ he says.
Moxie slips her hand into his.
‘This rule I can do.
But seriously, are you OK, Sam?
You do look peaky.’ Oh, totally fine.
‘I’m fine.’ He is not fine.
He’s about to lose everything.
He is not fine.
‘That’s his girlfriend, Isla,’ Moxie says.
She’s super gorgeous too.
Obviously has no standards.
Anyway.’ She nudges Sam with her hip.
People shout Moxie’s name and compliment her dress.
Quite a few are barefoot.
Quite a few are drunk.
Absolutely no one is dressed like Moxie and Sam.
Absolutely everyone keeps looking at them.
Behind his back.
‘Hi,’ says Sam.
‘It’s confirmed,’ Kirby says.
‘And he helped me sew.
He did quite a lot actually.’ ‘Keep him,’ Kirby says.
Her cheeks flush and she talks fifty miles a minute.
This happyMoxie is a sparkling explosion of life.
Sam steps back a little.
It scares him.
They’re not marks and he’s not stealing.
He doesn’t fit here.
Take me home.
Firelight dances in her eyes.
They definitely don’t look ready to go.
‘I’m fine.’ He tries to smile.
‘Sad-eyed?’ Sam says.
Just a little.
She smiles at that.
‘Dance with me.
Music punches out of the speakers.
Moxie is all twirling arms and spinning rainbow skirt.
She catches Sam’s hands and he whirls her around.
He can’t dance.
He’s all elbows and knees.
He doesn’t care.
Let him embarrass himself.
Just so long as he’s with Moxie.
The song ends and Moxie collapses against him.
‘Permanently,’ he says.
‘Thanks for that, by the way.’ ‘You’re welcome.
It’s like the entire night sings goodbye.
He runs his thumb over her bottom lip.
He kisses her.
Sam will hold her.
It’ll all be fine.
Moxie sighs into his shoulder.
Kirby is jogging towards them, face pinched.
‘Hey!’ he shouts.
‘Is that Sammy Lou?’ Sam’s hands drop away from Moxie.
The boy releases Sam’s throat.
He still can’t breathe.
‘What the hell?’ Moxie snaps.
‘Don’t touch him.
Who are you?’ Kirby arrives, breathless.
‘Um, OK, whoa.
Let’s calm down.
Moxie, this is Griffin.
Erm, Griffin … Moxie.
Or maybe it’s the ocean.
He can’t quite hear through the roar.
He can’t quite see.
He needs to get out of here.
‘You want to explain yourself?
Or do I just start yelling for my brothers?
Sam’s stomach knots.
‘They go to that public school on the south side.
‘And don’t talk like that about his brother.
She doesn’t even know Avery.
This is the Moxie he loves.
Griffin barely glances at her.
West is in so much therapy now.
You know who this kid is?
He’s a raging psychopath.’ Sam looks at his hands.
Avery was screaming.
Those stupid, goddamn bullies.
That’ll stop you twitching.
All because Avery thought they were his friends.
They strung him along and then cut him down.
Sam was going to kill them.
He was going to kill them all.
Moxie turns to Sam.
Her face is closed, unreadable, eyes obsidian in the dark.
I’ll get your brothers, Moxie.’ She runs off.
‘You should be in jail!’ Griffin shouts.
People are gathering now.
‘Call the cops.’ ‘No!’ Moxie cries.
‘What else do I need to say?’ Griffin snaps.
Sam drops to his knees.
Air explodes out of his lungs and doesn’t come back.
Yells collide and someone calls out frantically for Moxie.
The knot of people tightens.
Sam holds his stomach.
He tastes tears.
Why didn’t you run?
‘Don’t you dare hit him,’ she shouts.
Griffin staggers a few steps and then spins on Moxie.
Hands shoot out.
Snatch at shirts.
Stop is whispered.
She gives the smallest cry.
Sam’s world speeds up.
You do not touch Moxie.
You do not ever ever ever touch Moxie.
To do what they know best.
He doesn’t think.
He has to stop.
There’s sand in his mouth, in his eyes.
Sam tries to breathe but he hasn’t lungs any more.
Sam jerks away.
Griffin holds his broken nose and roars.
Their faces blur and spin before him.
They are red teeth and burned-out eyes.
They are horror and disgust and rage.
Scared of him.
Just like he was so scared of his father.
Only one girl doesn’t move.
He runs past her.
Run, just run.
Just run for ever.
It hurts and he’s glad.
He’s so glad.
He wants to hurt.
He deserves it.
You despicable boy, his aunt said.
They’re all right.
He’s just like his father.
He should be in prison.
He picks himself up and runs down the road.
He pulls out Avery’s phone.
Fix all your problems.
‘Vin?’ He’s crying.
‘Vin, let me talk to Avery.
‘Avery’s busy right now.’ No.
‘Please, d-don’t do this.
I need him.
I need him.’ ‘OK, OK, calm down, kid.
I can barely understand you.
What happened?’ ‘I h-h-hit … I just h-hit—’ Sam shatters.
He’s sobbing now, the phone slipping against his cheek.
‘Tell me where you are.
I’ll come get you.’ ‘I want Avery.
Please, I w-want Avery.’ ‘I’ll get him for you, kid.
Just hold on.’ It’s an impossible command.
Sam has nothing left to hold on to.
Sam covers his face.
The driver’s door pops open and Vin gets out.
Tips Sam’s chin up.
There’s blood on his hands.
‘Is it yours?’ she says.
Sam shakes his head.
He’s hollowed out.
Vin hauls Sam to his feet.
Vin gets in and revs the engine.
‘Eat.’ Sam turns his head away.
‘I’m not messing about, kid.
‘I’m going to be sick.’ ‘No, you’re not.
You’re taking a bite.
Go.’ She revs the engine again.
‘I don’t want to hang around here.
Do you?’ Sam takes a bite.
He tastes blood and no chocolate at all.
She doesn’t comment.
Chocolate melts and smears on Sam’s fingers.
He wipes it on his jeans.
He looks at his waistcoat, Moxie’s amazing, detailed work.
Bloodstains stare back.
‘So Avery’s working,’ Vin says finally.
Chocolate help?’ Sam didn’t taste it.
But he’s not shaking any more.
He leans his head against the window.
‘I can’t … please.
I’ll sort it all out, you hear me?
The sob comes out unbidden.
Sam presses his arm over his mouth.
How much goes away?
The whole summer?
Nothing else.’ Vin spins the steering wheel.
Streetlights flash in Sam’s eyes.
She pulls up and shuts off the engine.
‘I can’t,’ Sam whispers.
Can he even walk right now?
‘You do it, or I throw you to the cops.
Help me and I fix everything.
It’s not a decision.’ Sam swallows.
‘Get out of the car,’ Vin says.
Sam gets out of the car.
They walk three blocks.
She has a black duffle bag slung over a shoulder.
Sam has to admit – Vin knows what she’s doing.
There’s a sense of safety in that.
This is why Avery keeps working for her, isn’t it?
He wants to be safe, same as Sam.
He doesn’t want to be like this.
He focuses on Vin’s heeled boots.
Sam has no idea what time it is.
‘What is this place?’ His voice is low.
‘I have a contact overseas.
It’s an easy ten grand.’ ‘Ten grand?’ Sam stares.
Vin’s red lips twitch.
‘You get a cut, little angel.
Avery says you’re obsessed with having a house.
We can work something out.
If you stay on.
Keep working for me.’ Sam shifts his gaze away.
He wouldn’t – he can’t— He doesn’t want this.
He doesn’t want to admit he would fit.
He wants to forget what he’s good at.
Fists and theft.
‘See that window?
So they could fly.
Avery shouldn’t tell stuff like that.
It belongs to him and Sam.
‘I can.’ Sam’s mouth is dry.
She gives him a pair of thin gloves.
It’s not cold.
‘You just flip the off switch,’ she says.
Then unlock the back door.
Use your phone for light.
Easy, kid, so easy.
She tugs out her phone and frowns at the screen.
‘I’ll take this.
You got it?’ Sam nods.
Even Sam winces.
Don’t think about it now, Sammy.
Take a breath.
The building is tall and the window looks impossibly tiny.
He glances back.
Vin makes an angry flicking motion.
His fingers crawl across bricks.
It shudders under his weight, but he just moves faster.
Fast, boy, go fast.
His heart crashes hard in his chest.
Don’t look down.
Don’t look for Vin.
After this, he gets Avery.
He gets to hide.
It crashes to the floor inside.
The sound is an explosion over the empty car park.
He can’t see Vin.
His shoulders only just wedge through.
Don’t think about falling.
He flips down, silent as death.
He walks the halls.
Avoids the cameras.
Gets to the back door.
He shuts down the light, the camera, the alarms.
Once he unlocks that door, this place is Vin’s.
This is real and it’s big.
His fingers are red, a poisoned stain.
Moxie screams ‘Sam’ in his ears.
Not angry – frightened, desperate.
He feels hot.
He’s going to throw up.
He slides down the wall, holding his face.
Tears spill between his fingers.
If he does this, it’s the beginning, not the end.
And he will never see Moxie again.
He did that himself.
The doorknob jiggles and then there’s an urgent hiss.
‘Sammy.’ Sam hugs his legs tighter.
Are you there?
Won’t do it.
Can’t can’t can’t— The doorknob rattles again and Vin swears.
Open – this – door.’ Sam hits dial.
Emergency picks up.
‘Please,’ Sam whispers, giving the address of the art gallery.
‘It’s being robbed.
He’s out of time.
‘She’s going to kill me.’ He ends the call.
More than one set.
Sam’s heart skips a beat.
Vin’s is acid.
I had to come!
Avery can’t be here.
Sam just called the goddamn police.
He isn’t thinking.
Just let there have never been a Sammy Lou.
He leans his cheek against the cold door.
He has to get Avery out of here.
Nothing else matters.
Sam flips the lock.
Avery’s voice is high and trembling.
‘Who would know—’ ‘The kid,’ Vin snaps.
‘The kid has a phone.
Sam doesn’t stop.
Blue and red lights flash on the street.
‘Run!’ Vin gasps and pelts after Sam.
There’s a brief hesitation and then Avery takes off too.
They pound after him.
Chasing him or just getting away?
His lungs scream.
Sam hits the ground and keeps running.
But Avery trips.
And then Vin is on top of him.
Vin has Avery’s arm.
‘You dropped the bag of money, didn’t you?’ Vin says.
‘Our whole night’s work.’ She throws Avery on the ground.
Sam takes a step forward.
Vin’s lips peel back in a vicious smile.
Avery’s cry cuts the numb walls around Sam.
Red heat pours into Sam’s eyes.
He sags to his knees, hands to his head.
Vin picks something up from the piles of alley rubbish.
A broken piece of plywood spiked with bent rusted nails.
Avery scrabbles to get up.
I-I-I—’ Vin cracks the pole across Avery’s stomach.
He falls back down with a cry.
He needs it to stop spinning, please stop spinning.
‘You’re next, Sammy.
It catches Avery across the shoulder blades with sickening thwack.
He never runs.
Sam leaps forward.
Avery’s sob is broken.
Sam’s cry is blood.
She lands a punch on Sam’s jaw.
He raises his fist to her face.
Twice in one night his soul spills red.
But he can’t do this.
A sob ravages Sam’s chest.
He doesn’t want to do this any more.
Vin’s fingers claw at Sam’s waistcoat.
He’s not going to hit any more.
His world shudders.
He looks down.
He opens his mouth.
One bright spear of pain.
Behind him, Avery wails.
High-pitched and childish and terrified.
Vin drops into a crouch in front of Sam.
Vin’s face fills his whole vision.
He falls for ever.
He is going to die.
Avery catches his head before he hits the cement.
It runs thick and red.
So much of it.
It doesn’t really hurt.
Sam tries to tell Avery that.
Don’t cry, Avery.
‘I n-n-need you.
You c-c-can’t …’ His voice breaks.
‘Avery.’ Sam’s fist curls in Avery’s shirt.
The alley is quiet.
Vin is gone.
His stims get tangled when he’s upset.
Sam is so very good at making people upset.
No one hears.
No one comes.
Sam tries to cough but it hurts too much.
The pain is here, finally.
‘I’ll buy you a hundred houses.
I swear, I’ll do a-a-a-anything.
‘Don’t leave.’ But Avery’s already letting go.
Then it’s quiet.
Sam tries to put the pieces of himself together.
Tries, with cotton and screws and wishes.
But doesn’t he deserve this?
His ribs folds inwards as everything inside him shudders.
The boy turns invisible.
As he should be.
They try to pry his fingers open.
He’s too weak to stop them.
‘No, wait!’ Avery’s voice is panicked, words tripping over themselves.
‘Don’t take it.
We’ve got this.
He needs it!
Listen to me, listen, just—’ They leave Sam’s fingers alone.
‘What’s he holding anyway?’ ‘A key.
They need to understand the key.
If lost, please return to the De Laineys.
Sammy is fourteen and full of broken pieces.
He’s been here for a long time.
If he goes in, she’ll call the cops.
After what he did to those boys at school.
Or maybe that’s the wind.
Or maybe that’s him.
Being smashed to pieces.
Blood and broken bone and hollowed-out eyes.
And the screaming.
When they catch Sammy, they’ll take him away.
He deserves it.
He always goes too far.
He’ll die in prison.
He’ll die without Avery.
The curtain rips back and Avery’s there, eyes melting pools.
‘C-c-can you get my jumper?’ Sammy whispers.
The curtain falls and there’s a brief scuffling.
‘If Sammy’s there, I’m calling the cops!’ she shouts.
‘Come back inside, Avery.
You’ll get your cast wet.
‘Sammy.’ It’s a sob.
‘Hey.’ Sam clutches him, a drowning boy.
‘Hey – h-hey, you’ll get your cast wet.
He’s only just out of hospital.
‘I can’t.’ Sam glances desperately at the door.
Has she called the cops already?
I’m going to … I’m running away.’ ‘OK,’ Avery says.
‘I won’t have anywhere to live.
I’ll … I’ll steal.
I’ll steal houses.
Tears and rain.
And me,’ he says.
‘We.’ He’s too soft, they always said.
He shifts on the pillows, his eyelids swollen and sticky.
A chair scrapes.
Sheets rustle as elbows leans forward.
His fingers fold over it automatically.
‘They took it off you during surgery.
But you have it back now.
It’s OK, Sammy.’ Sam drags his eyes open.
His face feels stung and swollen, his throat flayed raw.
He looks terrible.
His clothes are gone.
Moxie’s waistcoat is gone.
He ruined it.
All her work.
She’ll yell at him for six days solid for— Oh.
There is no more Moxie.
There will be no more Moxie.
He wants Avery to deny it.
‘Yeah,’ says Avery, voice thick.
‘I’m sorry, Sammy.
I-I-I had to tell them everything.’ Oh.
But he just feels numb.
‘You had stitches,’ Avery says.
‘But it went in deep so … surgery.
It took a while.
‘I’m supposed to get the nurse when you wake up.
Do you hurt?
How bad?’ Bad.
‘I’m OK.’ Sam closes his eyes.
Sam puts a hand on Avery’s head.
‘I don’t think so.
Avery scrubs his eyes with the hem of his T-shirt.
‘Sammy, what was I supposed to do?
I couldn’t let you die.’ He’s going to jail.
A small part of his heart is glad.
He’s so tired.
Sammy – I can’t.
I need you.
‘I lied when I said I didn’t.
You know that, right?
I LIED —’ ‘Hey, hey, shh.
I know.’ Sam stretches out his fingers, brushing Avery’s wrist.
‘Have you slept?’ Avery shakes his head, whole body trembling.
‘My hands are going like a psycho,’ Avery says.
You need to move.
It’s OK.’ Avery whimpers.
‘Is this OK?’ Avery says.
‘I can move.’ ‘Don’t leave.’ ‘I’m not leaving.
‘I’m not leaving,’ Avery says.
The trick is to keep quiet.
The trick is to hold on to Avery.
It’s the falling.
Sometimes he can’t take a deep enough breath.
He won’t eat.
It’s been twenty-four hours, and he’s so, so sore.
It just slips back down.
They don’t want to see him as a child.
He curls tighter into a ball.
‘Excuse me, but you can’t be in here.’ Sam tenses.
‘But it says family, right?
I’m family.’ ‘Uh.
You look nothing like—’ ‘Oh, just five minutes.
I’ve run across the entire city to find him.
Let me see her.
It’s a fist to Sam’s already pulverised stomach.
‘How could you?’ He shrinks against the pillows.
‘What you did?
It’s you—’ She stops.
It’s you who’s the monster.
An ocean away.
‘We looked everywhere.
She lays her hands in her lap.
Doesn’t look at him.
‘I told my dad everything.
He wants to curl under it completely, disappear.
Her voice is tight.
‘Dad said he could’ve helped.’ Too late now.
‘He couldn’t.’ Sam’s heart punches holes in his chest.
And you don’t deserve to be caught?
Look what he did.
Look at his hands.
She slips a phone from her pocket.
Sam’s mouth is cotton and ash.
‘Just leave it, OK?
All waif and damp eyes and fluttering fingers.
‘And your brother?’ Moxie says, stiff now.
How is he going to help you?
You said he needs help.’ He does.
‘We’ll be fine.’ Sam rubs his knuckles over his eyes.
But at least she didn’t call anyone.
And then … then what even happened?’ Sam feels sick.
‘I got stabbed.’ Moxie’s eyes widen.
But she doesn’t.
By who?’ Sam closes his eyes.
‘Someone who hit Avery.’ Sam rubs his eyes again.
They keep filling up.
He’s so soft.
The trick is to not be so soft.
‘I’m sorry,’ he whispers.
‘I’m so so sorry.’ Moxie backhands her eyes furiously.
‘I know Griffin hit you first.
But … Sam, you scare me.’ He scares Avery too.
He scares himself.
I want to stop, he could scream.
I don’t want this to be my forever.
This is infinitely worse.
And even then, would it be enough?
Sam’s insides turn to ice.
Moxie pushes sweaty hair out of her eyes.
She turns to the social worker.
‘No visitors for my client.
Have the hospital staff notified.
She mouths, Let me help.
Sam gives the tiniest shake of his head.
Sam bunches his fists in the blankets.
He needs Avery.
They’re not going to let him have Avery.
The social worker holds out his hand to shake Sam’s.
‘Emery Evans,’ he says.
‘And this is your lawyer, Celia Polnik.
He has no words.
Can’t they see?
His thin chest moves raggedly.
Maybe a girl woke him on her way out.
‘OK,’ Avery says, ‘OK, I’m here.
Possibly a nap.
Possibly he could never wake up.
His fingers brush over the bandages taped to his stomach.
Or how often he screams himself awake at night.
No one knows what to do with him.
Avery, so far, slips through the cracks of everyone’s attention.
Sam pulls himself upright.
He seems satisfied.
‘Get your shirt.
Evans brought the clothes in earlier.
Ruined with blood and sliced by the knife.
They threw it out.
Don’t think of the waistcoat.
You’re not allowed.
You don’t deserve to.
‘Avery isn’t back yet,’ Sam says.
The man is all spider-thin fingers and a disapproving mouth.
‘He might not make it in time.
‘We’re not waiting.’ Sam understands.
Evans did this on purpose.
When Avery’s sleeping.
When Avery’s gone to try and find Aunt Karen.
Then his spider fingers will be all over Sam’s brother.
But he doesn’t want Avery at the courthouse.
But Sam can’t go without him.
He’s so empty.
Stars and buttons and caramel truffles.
Locked from the outside.
Evans’s car purrs smoothly through the city.
‘Am I going to jail?’ Sam says at last.
‘I can’t predict the judge.’ A non-answer.
Sam should be used to those.
Evans doesn’t notice.
‘You will eventually.
He’s ripping apart.
‘I need air,’ he whispers.
Then louder, ‘I need the window down.
Sam unbuckles his belt and puts his whole head out.
‘Sit back down,’ Evans commands.
Evans yells at his back.
‘You can’t afford to do this!’ Evan shouts.
Sam tucks his head and swerves amongst cars.
His shoes hit the sidewalk.
You have to get out of here.
Blood blooms across the white like spilt paint.
He’s good at running away.
It’s like ripping stitches.
It’s like the knife going in again and again.
He throws his tie away.
His legs know the destination even before his mind does.
Walk, Sammy, just walk.
They said they would help.
The sun bathes the world in dusky blues and pinks.
He slumps into the gutter in front of the house.
It’s late enough that everyone will be home.
Jeremy is probably cooking – it’s his night, isn’t it?
Toby is probably drawing on a wall.
Grady is reading and bossing everyone around.
Moxie is Moxie is Moxie is Moxie hates him.
Sam rests his face on his knees.
This house will never be his.
It tastes of cooler days and the end of summer.
It had to end.
Boots hit the footpath behind him.
He keeps his face pressed in his knees.
‘Sam.’ The voice is softness and sorrow.
Mr De Lainey drops down into the gutter beside Sam.
He doesn’t touch him.
He doesn’t look at his face.
He never wanted those disappointed eyes on him.
Why did Sam come back?
‘You’re lying.’ Sam shrinks into himself a little further.
But Mr De Lainey’s voice isn’t angry.
‘I know you’re looking for something, Sam,’ he says.
‘I know you found it here.
‘A family.’ His voice dries in his throat.
I know I know I know.
But the gaze before him is just sad and tired.
No more hiding and running.
You need help, real help.
They stay like that for a minute or a year.
‘And then you can let me know what we’re doing.
I won’t stop you if you leave.
‘I don’t want to go in,’ Sam says.
The sewing machine shuts off.
Sam takes a step towards the window.
He raises a trembling hand and taps the glass.
Moxie looks up.
Her hair is caught in a frizzy bun.
A scowl fits over her lips, all vinegar and suspicion.
When she sees him, the scowl falters.
Her lips part in surprise.
He pushes away from the window.
He deserves that.
All of it.
He should just walk away now.
Steal another house.
But he doesn’t doesn’t doesn’t want to.
Something like fear.
She doesn’t walk to him, she flies.
He expects a slap.
And she hugs him.
His arms slip around her back.
She is endlessly warm, like hugging waffles with honey.
‘I’m angry,’ she says fiercely.
‘I’m angry at you but I also care so much.
I told you that, didn’t I?
‘How dare you get stabbed?’ ‘I’m nothing,’ he says.
‘I’m sorry.’ She glances down then and sees his shirt.
She gives a sharp intake of breath.
‘You stupid beautiful boy.
Go sit on the steps.
Right now.’ Then she spins and runs inside.
Sam does as he’s told.
Then she unbuttons Sam’s shirt.
Blood soaks her fingertips.
He’s so cold.
He gets stuck lifting his arms high enough.
It’s Jeremy’s shirt, a superhero emblazoned on the front.
‘I’m sor—’ ‘No, don’t say sorry again.
‘I’m not Goldilocks.
I’m the monster in the woods.
I can’t stop myself.
And I don’t like it … I hate it.
I hate it.
I deserve jail.
She takes his hands and their fingers fit together.
It’s so, so unfair.
It’s salty tears and bloody memories and empty boxes.
She tastes of longing, he of tears.
Her eyes are wet when she smiles.
They look up.
‘Sammy.’ He gasps for breath.
‘And you’re just kissing – in the sunset?
Jeremy squeezes past the others on to the veranda.
‘Hey, the return of the second Sammy.’ He nudges Jack.
‘He looks like a wild sort of elf.
A lost boy from Peter Pan.’ Jack snorts.
‘I think he swam here.’ ‘I ran,’ Avery growls.
Avery seems to have regained his breath.
‘And then Sam’s deciding if he’s going back or not.
Sam snaps his gaze to Mr De Lainey.
What is he doing?
‘I work in construction,’ Mr De Lainey says.
‘I have my own business.
The De Lainey father gets it.
Avery just stares.
But he sets his jaw and doesn’t shrink away.
‘What about Sam?’ Avery says.
‘That’s if Sam chooses to go back to court.
Finally he swears.
Jack gives a low whistle.
‘Dinner’s in five minutes.
Avery, come inside and get some water.
Well, she did.
Just a little.
She matches his look, blade for blade.
‘It’s a joke,’ Sam says.
‘You’ll like their food.
‘You shut up.
You scared me to death, you know that?
All his people are here.
Everything he loves.
‘Would you?’ he says.
‘Would you stay?
Sam is tired.
Sam can’t do this any more.
It folds over him.
Dishes and voices clash behind them.
Then he sets a phone next to Sam.
The phone might as well be another knife.
Except maybe he won’t be alone for ever.
So Sammy Lou picks up the phone.
The whole team at Orchard Books!
Thank you for your advice and flails!
You have been a mountain of encouragement.
Except you, Jemima.
At the wrist would be best.
How sick is that?
He’d be a scene out of a horror movie.
And he’d be free.
Because, without hands, he’s worthless to her.
To the Maestro.
He won’t even try something like that.
A taste of fudge and freedom isn’t worth it?
He’s just not made for rebellion or risks.
Fantasising is all he’s good for.
Sick dreams of mutilation, apparently.
Which hand would he even cut off?
It scares Beck Keverich – the way he thinks sometimes.
His digital clock reads 5:12.
And he should’ve been up twelve minutes ago.
Beck peels his head off the pillows.
He wishes he could dissolve into them.
Did he even sleep last night?
His wrists ache like he’s been juggling blocks of cement.
Did he quit at eleven?
His fingers moan, it was midnight, you fool.
His fingers are cantankerous like that.
He slams the piano lid open.
The Steinway upright is the sole glory of his room.
Not that there’s much else in the room.
Although her curled lips and glares also speak volumes.
Schreckliche means terrible.
It’s a summary of Beck.
You are an awful pianist.
Your music has no future.
You have no talent.
Why don’t you play faster, better, clearer?
Why do you hit the wrong notes all the time?
Now for staccato notes.
Double fifth scales.
Diminished seventh exercises.
Trills for his iced fingers to fall across.
By 8 a.m.
Of walking out and never coming back.
Play the music on the paper.
No one cares about the songs in your head.
She’s exhausting just to look at.
‘IT’S FIFTEEN MINUTES TILL WE GO,’ Joey bellows.
He can hear, he just can’t multitask and answer.
He hates these pieces the Maestro demands he learn.
It’s past eight.
He’s not even dressed or had breakfast.
Joey’s face puckers.
‘I made you lunch,’ Joey says, spider-climbing up his doorframe.
‘A surprise lunch.
She gives an indignant squeak and drops from the walls.
She’s giggling before he even starts to beg.
‘Don’t punish me.
‘I’m a scrumptious cook.
The ‘comprehension’ was, of course, nonexistent.
Hence Beck was late to pick up Joey.
There’s a state championship coming up to obligingly stress everyone.
‘OK, calm down.
My delicate self-worth can only take so much.
He removes it.
‘I’m sorry I play the same song so much.
I’m – practising.
Predictably, breakfast is cornflakes with a side dish of disapproval.
Who is Beck kidding?
That shade of yellow never looked good.
She tutors musicianship and theory at the university.
Beck wonders how often her students cry.
Beck slinks past, telling himself he did everything right.
She has nothing to erupt about.
It’ll be OK – totally OK.
With milk, it’ll become sludge.
Beck watches the Maestro’s red pen whip over the music.
Beck checks the plastic bag with his squashed sandwich.
Joey has a thing about making his lunch.
Maybe he’d rather not know.
‘You’ll be late.’ The Maestro’s voice is deep and raspy.
Preschool is blissfully free of dress regulations.
They have to do this now?
Joey kicks the front door open with her glittered gumboots.
‘I’m gonna beat you there!’ she yells.
‘Ja, Mutter?’ He uses German as a tentative appeasement.
Painfully slow seconds tick by like swats against Beck’s face.
He has to get out.
Needs to leave.
‘You woke late,’ the Maestro says.
‘I’m sorry.’ Suck up.
It’s the only way to get out alive.
The Maestro snorts.
‘Why are you inept at dedication and commitment?
It trembles violently and coffee sloshes over the side.
Which is highly likely.
He doesn’t like her to cross the road alone.
‘Ja, of course you are sorry.
A little parrot with only one phrase to say.
He doesn’t want to do this again.
He’s going to be late.
Her hand flashes out of nowhere and slaps his face.
The shock of it sends him a step backwards.
He always forgets how fast she can move.
‘Do not disrespect me!’ she snaps.
‘School is not important.
I am speaking to you.
That is important.’ Beck does nothing.
‘The piano is life.
You shame my name.
You’ll amount to nothing, Sohn, nothing!
Are you listening?’ ‘Yes, Mutter.’ Beck speaks to his shoes.
‘Is my advice a joke to you?
LOOK AT ME WHEN I SPEAK.’ Also by C.G.

I’ve always needed both.
Most people exist, that’s all.
—Oscar Wilde September 5, 2017 MATEO TORREZ 12:22 a.m.
Not that I will ever know for sure.
I’m going to .
My chest tightens.
I’m dying today.
I’ve always been afraid of dying.
Wow, I’m actually .
I don’t want to pick up the phone.
The caller ID reads DEATH-CAST, of course.
I’m shaking but manage to press Talk.
I don’t say anything.
I’m not sure what to say.
“Hello, I’m calling from Death-Cast.
You there, Timothy?” Timothy.
My name isn’t Timothy.
“You’ve got the wrong person,” I tell Andrea.
I truly do.
“Mateo, kindly confirm this is indeed you.
She has no sympathy to offer me.
It’s basically Twitter for Deckers.
.” I’ve only ever been to one funeral.
If I had more friends than I do fingers.
I sink to the floor, on my knees.
And that’s it.
No one has ever wronged me.
Really, I do.
I’m such a paranoid mess.
Maybe he’s dating someone, and maybe he likes that company.
But I will never grow up to be Future Mateo.
Not even that.
Do, and then die.
I’m not going to tell anyone.
No one should spend their last hours second-guessing people.
wow, the last time ever.
I’ll be gone before I can adjust to my mortality.
I also have to see Lidia and her one-year-old, Penny.
Short answer: He isn’t.
I won’t even be a ghost to her.
I haven’t worn it outside yet.
At least I could fall asleep during my free periods.
I shouldn’t have taken those frees for granted.
It’s 12:58 a.m.
It’s 1:00 a.m.
I can’t believe I’m never returning to my bedroom.
I shake my head and slam the door shut.
RUFUS EMETERIO 1:05 a.m.
But nothing, just my phone.
“You gotta pick it up, Roof,” Tagoe says.
“The hell I do,” I say.
These Death-Cast calls go strong until three.
I don’t know either.
My phone stops ringing.
“Maybe it was a mistake,” Malcolm says.
My phone rings again.
Malcolm stays shut.
I wasn’t hopeful.
And we Emeterios haven’t exactly been lucky with staying alive.
But meeting our maker way ahead of time?
We’re your guys.
“Maybe he got a weapon on him,” Malcolm says.
But I’m not betting my life, not like this.
I drop my phone.
I stand and he stays down.
“Who you calling for?” His neck twitch surprises no one.
“Hold up, hold up.
I ain’t him.
Wait a sec.” He holds out the phone.
“You want me to hang up, Roof?” I don’t know.
“Watch him,” I tell Tagoe and Malcolm.
I don’t know how I became the alpha dog.
I ended up in the foster home years after them.
“You’re calling after one.” It’s bullshit.
Other Deckers got their alert an hour ago.
“Yes, you’re right.
I’m sorry,” Victor says.
First of all, how are you doing?
It took a while for you to answer.
“Just tell me my options.” This should be good.
“How do you guys know?” I interrupt.
“The End Days.
How do you know?
Screw this guy.
“Yo, Victor, be a person for one minute.
I don’t know if you know, but I’m seventeen.
Three weeks from my eighteenth birthday.
“You want me to be a person, Rufus?
Rufus, I feel for you, I do.
Can you do me a solid and cooperate?” Damn.
The damage is done—will be done.
Today is my End Day, a straight-up Rufus Armageddon.
I don’t know how this is gonna go down.
I’m praying I don’t drown like my parents and sis.
Maybe Peck is gonna be responsible for this.
I walk back over to the three of them, fast.
“You didn’t ‘beat’ me, okay?
Not much life left.
“You feel me?” Peck nods.
Malcolm stomps it out.
“Get the hell out of here.” Malcolm grabs my shoulder.
“Don’t let him go.
I shake Malcolm off my shoulder.
“I wasn’t gonna kill him.” Malcolm and Tagoe are quiet.
I can’t stop shaking.
I could’ve killed him, even if I didn’t mean to.
But I’m not hard.
I storm toward our bikes.
He nods again, no twitch this time.
“You two are straight-up shadows,” I say.
“That because we’re black?” Malcolm asks.
“Because you’re always following me,” I say.
“Loyal to the end.” The end.
That shuts us up.
“Let’s go home,” I say.
And we out.
MATEO 1:06 a.m.
I’m not naive about dying.
I know it’s going to happen.
But I don’t have to rush into it.
I’m buying myself more time.
The Decker was twenty-two-year-old Keith.
I don’t know how Keith died.
I don’t know.
Except there is, it just exists in magnetic vibrations.
I switch to the Neptune track.
RUFUS 1:18 a.m.
We’re riding to Pluto in the dead of night.
But right now, all that matters is we’re still together.
The building is massive, with off-white bricks and maroon steeples.
Doesn’t matter anyway.
I climb off the bike, throwing down the kickstand.
This woman has gotta be a Decker, or know one.
The graveyard shift here is no joke.
I call Aimee.
It rings six times before going to voice mail.
I call again and it’s the same thing.
She’s ignoring me.
I type out a text: Death-Cast called me.
Maybe you can too.
Nah, I can’t be a dick and send that.
I correct myself: Death-Cast called me.
Can you call me back?
“Hey.” “Are you serious?” Aimee asks.
“I’m with Malcolm and Tagoe.” “Why aren’t you at Pluto?
“We’re headed back to Pluto now.
Can you meet us there?” “What?
I’m getting dressed, do not move.
“Meet me at home.
get to me.
Bye, Aimee.” I hang up before she can protest.
“What’s the plan?” Malcolm asks.
“We’re going back to Pluto,” I tell them.
Or maybe that’s how it has to be.
MATEO 1:32 a.m.
Scrolling through CountDowners is a very serious downer.
No one; good.
I randomly select a Decker.
I’m sure he’ll get through okay.
I switch to another feed.
I have to visit Dad, even if he’s unconscious.
Well, Dad did all the work.
I was laughing at him.
I swear this isn’t an excuse to not go outside.
RUFUS 1:41 a.m.
We’re on the block with that Decker-friendly club, Clint’s Graveyard.
There’s the fireplace that doesn’t work but still looks dope.
“You’ve come really far.
I’ll be lucky to get twelve hours.
“What, it’s true!
“You guys gotta do me the biggest favor.
Wake up Jenn Lori and Francis.
“You should stay here,” Malcolm says.
He opens up the only closet.
“Maybe we can beat this.
You can be the exception!
I sit up.
I can’t let them see me freaking.
“I’m not offing myself,” I say.
I’m not trying to die.
Those were mad chill times.
Like I still have a chance with her.
We keep it simple here.
Walking out of here .
I really don’t wanna go.
MATEO 1:52 a.m.
I’m almost ready to go.
How do I sum up my life in eight words?
He Lived Where He Died: In His Bedroom.
What a Waste of a Life.
Children Take More Risks Than Him.
I have to do better.
Everyone wanted so much more out of me, myself included.
I have to honor this.
It’s my last day to do so.
Here Lies Mateo: He Lived for Everyone.
I hit Submit.
There’s no going back.
I can’t do this alone, the leaving part.
I’m really not dragging Lidia into my End Day.
But it’s not always sweet like that.
Time is wasting.
I download the Last Friend app on my phone.
Dying Today Not Dying Today I click Dying Today.
A message pops up: We here at Last Friend Inc.
are collectively sorry for this loss of you.
Please fill out the profile for best results.
Deeply sorry to lose you, Last Friend Inc.
A blank profile pops up and I fill it out.
I want to make him proud and break out.
After that, I don’t know.
Final Thoughts: I’m going for it.
I submit my answers.
The app prompts me to upload a photo.
There’s my junior year photo, which is lame.
But I was wrong, go figure.
RUFUS 1:59 a.m.
My foster parents are waiting downstairs.
I grab my helmet because safety first.
I take one last look at the room.
Malcolm gives me a little smile.
I would too if the cards were reversed.
“You actually got Francis awake?” I ask.
I follow Malcolm downstairs.
Francis is too white to rock a fade, though.
“One less mouth to feed, right?” No one laughs.
I don’t know how to do this.
It takes another minute, but we get several rounds going.
Francis and Jenn Lori are easy to beat.
I go up against Tagoe and Rock beats Scissors.
“Do-over,” Malcolm says.
I give Tagoe a friendly bro push.
“Because you’re a dick.” The doorbell rings.
“Are you kidding me?” Aimee asks.
I shake my head.
MATEO 2:02 a.m.
19 years old.
Manhattan, New York (2 miles away).
I click her profile.
I move past it and click her photo.
I open the message.

How’s it going?
(2:08 a.m.): Hey, Philly.
Is it too lame to say I’m hanging in there?
(2:08 a.m.): Nah, I’m sure it’s rough.
Not looking forward to the day Death-Cast calls me.
Are you sick or something?
Pretty young to be dying.
(2:09 a.m.): I’m healthy, yeah.
(2:09 a.m.): I can help with that, Mateo.
(2:09 a.m.): Help with what?
(2:09 a.m.): Making sure you don’t die.
(2:09 a.m.): That’s not a thing anyone can promise.
(2:10 a.m.): I can.
I block Philly and open up Elle’s message.
Maybe the third time will be the charm.
RUFUS 2:21 a.m.
“Look at him, Rufus.
“Not feeling so brave now, right?” Peck asks.
Aimee drags me into the living room by my wrist.
.” “What?” “There’s no point lying.
“Look, Ames, I was freaking out.
“We didn’t make sense anymore.
Sorry.” I back up.
“Nah, you good.” “We should do the funeral,” Tagoe says.
“But take your time.
It’s your day.
“I’m gonna get everyone in here.” He steps.
“I don’t want to hog you,” Aimee says.
She doesn’t let me go, not until everyone comes in.
I needed that hug.
I stay seated in the center of the couch.
I’m battling my lungs for my next breath, hard-core.
Peck keeps his distance, playing around on Aimee’s phone.
The others .
“They all cried, but your eyes were so sad, Rufus.
He’s not talking about tonight, I know that.
Francis keeps staring but doesn’t say anything else.
“We don’t have all day.” He waves Malcolm over.
“You were—you are our bro, Roof.
This is bullshit.
“They should take me instead.” “Don’t say that.
Seriously, shut up.” “I’m serious,” he says.
You matter more than other people.
Not saying sorry either.
“I’m dying and we can’t trade lives.
“Roof, I’ll miss you shutting us up like this.
There’s another cliché for you, whatever.
I want to wake up.
There’s only one person who isn’t surprised or freaking out.
“You didn’t,” Aimee says, charging toward him.
She snatches her phone from him.
“He assaulted me!” Peck shouts.
“Go out the back,” Tagoe says, twitches running wild.
Jenn Lori points at the kitchen.
I don’t know where I’m going, but I keep going.
MATEO 2:52 a.m.
The third time was not the charm.
Cove’s got it good.
I won’t be able to respawn later.
I’m wasting away in here and .
There are two bookcases in my room.
I tear down a map from the wall.
It’s chaos in here.
I have to make a move.
RUFUS 2:59 a.m.
Wish Death-Cast called before I ruined my life tonight.
I hear police sirens and keep pedaling.
I hope something else is happening.
Shit, I’m the bad guy.
I can’t keep moving, though.
I sit on the curb outside the gas station.
It smells like piss and cheap beer.
In orange spray paint it says: The Last Friend App.
I keep getting dicked out of proper goodbyes.
The loyalty Malcolm showed me time and time again.
I can’t go back now.
Maybe I shouldn’t have run.
I gotta make this up to the Plutos.
They spoke nothing but truth during their eulogies.
I’ve messed up a bit lately, but I’m good.
I really don’t wanna be alone.
I stare at the Last Friend silhouettes on the wall.
I enter the app store and I download Last Friend.
MATEO 3:14 a.m.
This diminishes the online numbers significantly.
I click on his profile.
Name: Rufus Emeterio Age: 17.
Weight: 169 lbs.
Job: Professional Time Waster.
Bucket List: Do it up.
Final Thoughts: It’s about time.
I’ve made mistakes, but I’m gonna go out right.
Maybe he’s suicidal.
I’m going to reach out.
There’s nothing risky about hello.
(3:17 a.m.): sorry you’ll be lost, Rufus.
I’m not used to reaching out to strangers like this.
(3:19 a.m.): Hey, Mateo.
He’s already connecting to the person I want to become.
(3:19 a.m.): Thanks.
Think I’m going to leave the hat here at home.
I don’t want the attention.
(3:19 a.m.): Good call.
A Luigi hat isn’t exactly a baseball cap, right?
(3:19 a.m.): Exactly.
(3:20 a.m.): Wait.
You haven’t left your house yet?
(3:20 a.m.): Nope.
(3:20 a.m.): Death-Cast called me a little after midnight.
(3:20 a.m.): What have you been doing all night?
(3:20 a.m.): Cleaning and playing video games.
(3:20 a.m.): Which game?
(3:21 a.m.): N/m the game doesn’t matter.
Don’t you have stuff you wanna do?
What are you waiting for?
not great, is the kindest way to put it.
(3:22 a.m.): I asked you first.
(3:22 a.m.): Fair.
(3:23 a.m.): I spoke to that dick too!
Not his dick, exactly.
But I reported and blocked him afterward.
I promise I’m better than that guy.
I guess that’s not saying much.
Do you wanna video-chat?
I’ll send you the invite.
An icon of a silhouette speaking into a phone flashes.
“You see me?” “Yeah, hey.
I’m Mateo.” “Hey, Mateo.
I wonder why he’s so sweaty.
“Unless that’s too personal.” “Nah, don’t worry about that.
I don’t think ‘too personal’ should exist between Last Friends.
But not doing anything is hardly comforting, either.
I can do it.” “Can you?
There’s the whole you-not-leaving-your-house problem.
“Believe me, I know it can get ugly out here.
I’m not leaving the safety of my apartment that easily.
“And I would’ve been game with game over.
You gotta go for it.” Go for it.
That’s what I said in my profile.
“Okay,” I say.
“How do we do this?
Where we should we meet?
“I’m gonna find a different Last Friend.” “It’s really not!
I swear.” I almost drop the phone.
I’ve screwed everything up.
“Seriously, I—” “I’m kidding, dude,” he says.
Except this time it’s okay to fully relax—I think.
“Will do,” I say.
“See you in a bit, Mateo.
“Be safe, Rufus.” Rufus nods and ends the video chat.
It doesn’t matter how many times we look both ways.
Shedd ANDREA DONAHUE 3:30 a.m.
Rule number one of one: Deckers are no longer people.
Andrea knows there’s nothing she can do for these Deckers.
She won’t waste her breath praying for them.
She simply tells them they’re dying and moves on.
She doesn’t just tell people they’re dying.
She gives them a chance to really live.
But she can’t live for them.
That’s on them.
She’s already done her part, and she does it well.
RUFUS 3:31 a.m.
I’m biking toward that Mateo kid’s house.
Nah, he’s chill.
If not, we can always part ways.
It makes me feel a little better, at least.
MALCOLM ANTHONY 3:34 a.m.
“They’re not gonna find Rufus.
This is assuming Rufus is still alive.
But they’ll have their lives.
MATEO 3:42 a.m.
“It’s Rufus,” he says from the other side.
He nods at me.
But the hallway is empty and now Rufus is smiling.
“I’m on your turf, dude,” Rufus says.
“If anyone should be suspicious, it’s me.
“I’m sorry, I’m just .
His palm is sweaty.
“You ready to bounce?
This is a trick question, obviously.” “I’m ready-ish,” I answer.
I lock up.
I don’t feel uneasy, but I am guarded.
And that he’s also dying today.
“Whoa, we’re not taking the elevator,” Rufus says.
The elevator is risky.
We get stuck.
We get downstairs safely.
My hand hovers over the lobby door.
I can’t do it.
It’s a nice second away from reality.
“Go ahead,” Rufus says.
I don’t want to disappoint either of us, especially myself.
But being out here now is different.
There are lights on in my neighbors’ apartments.
Rufus claps, snapping me out of my trance.
“Bucket lists are pointless.
You’re not gonna get everything done.
I know it before Rufus shakes his head.
“Yeah, well,” Rufus says.
I just .
“This isn’t going to work.
It’s going to backfire on us.
Like a Decker hot zone.
“No point fearing it.” “Not that easy.
We’re not dying from natural causes.
I’m driving him crazy.
Don’t do your last day wrong.” Rufus is right.
I know he’s right.
No more arguing.
“We can do that,” Rufus says.
“I have nothing I’m gunning to do.
“What happened?” I say.
“Nonsense.” Rufus doesn’t elaborate.
But maybe that warning wouldn’t have mattered.
Rufus sees the bird too.
“Say what?” “I don’t have this dead-is-dead-so-just-walk-away attitude,” I say.
I need to check myself.
Again.” I quit my hunt.
“Here’s the thing.
The way its eyes darted around for help.
The bird dared to leave home, at least.
“What happened then?” “I have no idea,” I admit.
“Let me find you something for the bird,” he says.
Rufus appears beside me on his bike, pedaling slowly.
“It’s a couple minutes after four,” Rufus informs me.
I know many people won’t agree or understand this sentiment.
But birds do all of this too.
Other birds are living until their time is up.
“Sorry,” Rufus says.
Yo, Mateo is too good.
But I’m mad shocked to meet someone so .
